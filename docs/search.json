    "text": "Description\nAn electrocardiogram (ECG) is a simple test that can be used to check your heart’s rhythm and electrical activity. Sensors attached to the skin are used to detect the electrical signals produced by the heart each time it beats.\n\n\nIntroduction\nCardiovascular diseases are one of the leading causes of death worldwide. An ECG is the most representative and important non-invasive tool for diagnosing cardiac abnormalities. At every beat, the heart is depolarized to trigger its contraction. This electrical activity is transmitted throughout the body and can be picked up on the skin. An ECG machine records this activity via electrodes on the skin and displays it graphically.\nAn ECG is a graph of voltage with respect to time that reflects the electrical activities of cardiac muscle depolarization followed by repolarization during each heartbeat. The ECG graph of a normal beat consists of a sequence of waves, a P-wave representing the atrial depolarization process, a QRS complex denoting the ventricular depolarization process, and a T-wave representing the ventricular repolarization. Other portions of the signal include the PR, ST, and QT intervals.\nCommonly, 10 electrodes attached to the body are used to form 12 ECG leads, with each lead measuring a specific electrical potential difference. Electrodes combinations can measure the electrical potential difference between two corresponding locations of attachment. Such a pair forms a lead. The different leads are regularly divided into limb; augmented limb; and precordial or chest leads. The 12-lead ECG has a total of three limb leads (I, II, II) and three augmented limb leads (aVR, aVL, aVF) corresponding to a coronal plane (vertical), and six precordial leads or chest leads (V1-V6) that lie on the perpendicular transverse plane (horizontal).\nA resting 12-lead ECG is recorded at each visit for participants. The record length is 10 seconds and the sample rate is 1000Hz. We collect both the raw waveform ECG signal from all leads and tabular data. The tabular data are features which have been extracted automatically by the machine from the raw data such as the P wave duration.\n\n\nMeasurement protocol\n\nA 10 second resting electrocardiogram (ECG) using a 12 Lead Norav ECG machine is done for each participant. The equipment used includes an electrode belt, limb crocodile clips, a 12 Lead Norav ECG machine, and a device cart and computer.\nThe device settings include a sample rate of 1000Hz, a minimum test time of 10 seconds, and various filters such as an AC noise filter, EMG filter, and a baseline filter. The protocol involves turning on the computer and entering the “resting ECG” software, verifying the participant’s identity, and attaching the electrode belt and limb crocodile clips to the participant’s chest. The figure below shows the software system used to record the ECG.\nThe participant is instructed to take normal deep breaths and to remain still during the 10 second recording. The ECG is then interpreted and, if necessary, the test can be repeated.\n\n\n\necg info\n\n\n\n\nData availability\n\nThe information is stored in 2 tabular parquet files: ecg.parquet, ecg_qc.parquet, which contain tabular features and QC checks on the raw ECG waveform data. Mutiple time series parquet files contain the raw and processed ECG waveform data\n\n\nSummary of available data\n\n\nRaw waveform signal: a data frame for each participant containing the raw ECG signal from the 12 different leads.\nProcessed waveform signal: a data frame for each participant containing the processed ECG signal from the 12 different leads using the NeuroKit python package.\nTabular features: a data frame containing ECG related features extracted automatically by the machine.\nPDF showing the ECG machine’s output.\n\n\n\nRelevant links\n\nPheno Data

    "text": "Description\nCurated phenotypes are algorithmically-defined health conditions and traits derived from the rich, multi-modal data collected in the Human Phenotype Project. These phenotypes are created by integrating multiple data sources including clinical measurements, laboratory tests, imaging data, questionnaires, medical history, and other assessments to provide robust definitions of diseases and health states. Each curated phenotype follows evidence-based criteria and clinical guidelines to ensure accurate classification of participants’ health status.\n\n\nIntroduction\nThe Human Phenotype Project includes curated phenotypes for major health conditions across multiple domains:\n\nMetabolic Conditions\n\nAbdominal Adiposity: Increased abdominal obesity is a hallmark of fat or adiposity-related metabolic dysfunction.\nBMI and Obesity: Overweight and obesity are associated with morbidity and mortality can lead to significant social and psychological challenges for individuals, including stigma, discrimination, and increased risk of mental health issues such as depression and low self-esteem.\nDiabetes: Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) is a health condition characterized by blood sugar levels that are higher than normal, whereas in prediabetes blood sugar levels are not high enough yet to be classified as T2D.\nHyperlipidemia: Lipoproteins are complexes of lipids and proteins that are essential for transport of cholesterol, triglycerides (TGs), and fat-soluble vitamins in the blood. Disorders of lipoprotein metabolism include primary and secondary conditions that substantially increase or decrease specific circulating lipids (e.g., cholesterol or TGs) or lipoproteins (e.g., low density or high density lipoproteins).\nMAFLD: Metabolic (dysfunction) Associated Fatty Liver Disease / Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) was described as an excessive fat infiltration of the liver in the absence of significant alcohol consumption or other causes of liver disease.\n\n\n\nCardiovascular Conditions\n\nHypertension: Hypertension is the most common reason for office visits and for the use of chronic prescription medications. Roughly one-half of hypertensive individuals do not have adequate blood pressure control.\nIschemic Heart Disease: Ischemic heart disease (IHD), also referred to as coronary heart disease (CHD), is the term associated with an inadequate supply of blood to the myocardium due to obstruction of the epicardial coronary arteries, usually from atherosclerosis.\n\n\n\nKidney Disease\n\nCKD: Chronic Kidney Disease includes a range of pathophysiologic processes associated with abnormal kidney function and a progressive decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR).\n\n\n\nNeurological and Psychiatric Conditions\n\nADHD: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), one of the most common neuropsychiatric disorders of childhood and adolescence, often persists into adulthood.\nAnxiety: People with anxiety disorders frequently have intense, excessive and persistent worry and fear about everyday situations.\nDepression: Depression is a constellation of symptoms and signs that may include depressed mood.\nMigraine: Migraine is an episodic disorder that manifests in a severe headache generally associated with nausea and/or light and sound sensitivity.\n\n\n\nSleep Disorders\n\nOSA: Obstructive Sleep Apnea is a disorder that is characterized by obstructive apneas, hypopneas, and/or respiratory effort-related arousals caused by repetitive collapse of the upper airway during sleep.\nSleep Quality: Sleep is considered a restorative process that allows for energy renewal and also for cellular. Low sleep quality may lead to accelerated aging by triggering DNA damage and chronic inflammation to influence the compensatory/resiliency systems of the human body.\n\n\n\nMusculoskeletal Conditions\n\nSarcopenia: Sarcopenia is a syndrome characterized by the loss of muscle mass, strength, and performance.\nOsteoporosis: Osteoporosis is characterized by low bone mass, microarchitectural disruption, and skeletal fragility, resulting in decreased bone strength and an increased risk of fracture.\n\n\n\nWomen’s Health\n\nEndometriosis: Endometriosis is a gynecological disease defined as endometrial glands and stroma that occur outside the uterine cavity.\nMenopause: Natural menopause is defined as the permanent cessation of menstrual periods, determined retrospectively after a woman has experienced 12 months of amenorrhea without any other obvious pathologic or physiologic cause.\n\n\n\nCancer\n\nNMSC: Nonmelanoma Skin Cancers are a group of cancers that arise from the skin but do not include melanoma. The most common types of nonmelanoma skin cancer are basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).\n\n\n\n\nMeasurement protocol\n\nCurated phenotypes are not directly measured but are derived through algorithmic integration of multiple data sources collected in the Human Phenotype Project. The curation process involves:\n\nData Integration: Combining relevant measurements from various modalities (e.g., blood tests, imaging, questionnaires, clinical assessments)\nClinical Criteria Application: Applying established clinical diagnostic criteria and guidelines for each condition\nAlgorithm Development: Creating data-driven algorithms that identify individuals meeting criteria for specific phenotypes\nValidation: Validating phenotype definitions against known diagnoses and clinical assessments\nQuality Control: Ensuring consistency and accuracy of phenotype assignments across the cohort\n\nEach phenotype uses specific combinations of available data types relevant to that condition. For example:\n\nDiabetes phenotypes use blood glucose, HbA1c, CGM data, medications, and self-reported diagnoses\nCardiovascular phenotypes integrate blood pressure, ECG, imaging, blood tests, and medical history\nLiver phenotypes combine liver ultrasound, blood tests, and clinical assessments\n\n\n\nData availability\n\nCurated phenotypes are provided as derived datasets that indicate presence, absence, or severity of specific conditions for each participant. The data is typically stored in parquet files with phenotype assignments linked to participant IDs and research stages, enabling longitudinal tracking of health status changes over time.\n\n\nSummary of available data\n\nThe curated phenotypes dataset includes algorithmically-defined classifications for major health conditions and traits:\nMetabolic Conditions:\n\nBMI and Obesity: Body mass index categories and obesity status based on anthropometric measurements\nDiabetes: Type 2 diabetes and prediabetes status derived from glucose levels, HbA1c, CGM data, and medications\nHyperlipidemia: Lipid disorders identified through blood lipid panels and lipoprotein profiles\nMAFLD: Metabolic-associated fatty liver disease based on liver ultrasound and metabolic markers\nAbdominal Adiposity: Increased abdominal fat based on body composition measurements\n\nCardiovascular Conditions:\n\nHypertension: High blood pressure classifications from multiple blood pressure readings\nIschemic Heart Disease: Coronary heart disease identified through clinical history, tests, and procedures\n\nKidney Disease:\n\nCKD: Chronic kidney disease stages based on estimated glomerular filtration rate and kidney function tests\n\nNeurological and Psychiatric Conditions:\n\nADHD: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder based on standardized questionnaires\nAnxiety: Anxiety disorders derived from psychological health assessments\nDepression: Depressive symptoms and disorders from mental health questionnaires\nMigraine: Migraine headache patterns from symptom reports\n\nSleep Disorders:\n\nOSA: Obstructive sleep apnea based on home sleep study results and respiratory indices\nSleep Quality: Sleep quality metrics from sleep monitoring and questionnaires\n\nMusculoskeletal Conditions:\n\nSarcopenia: Age-related muscle loss identified through body composition and grip strength\nOsteoporosis: Low bone density from DXA scans and fracture risk assessment\n\nWomen’s Health:\n\nEndometriosis: Endometriosis diagnosis from medical history and procedures\nMenopause: Menopausal status and transition based on reproductive history and hormonal changes\n\nCancer:\n\nNMSC: Nonmelanoma skin cancers (basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma) from medical history\n\nEach phenotype provides a binary classification (presence/absence), and where applicable, severity grades or continuous measures. The phenotypes are updated as new data becomes available during longitudinal follow-up.",

    "text": "Description\nThe lab tests in this dataset of the Human Phenotype Project are based on tests performed to participants in the community as part of their regular medical care at their HMO (Health Maintenance Organization). Participants are asked to upload their blood/urine tests done at their HMOs from previous years. These tests range from the very common CBC and chemistry tests, vitamins levels and other laboratory tests.\n\n\nIntroduction\nLaboratory (Lab) tests are often used in health care to determine physiological and biochemical states, such as disease, mineral content, pharmaceutical drug effectiveness, and organ function. The lab tests in this data set of the Human Phenotype Project are based on tests performed to participants in the community as part of their regular medical care at their HMO. Following registration and follow-up calls or visits the participants receive an email asking for and providing instructions on how to upload their lab test results. The participants are provided with a list of recommended tests to upload (specified in the list below) and the recommended time window for some tests (last 3 months or from the previous one year). Each participant uploads blood tests that were done throughout the years with their HMO. Upon upload, the file is analyzed based on its format, and all readable tests that can be extracted are uploaded to a PostgreSQL database.\nNote that this data is created by the users own volition and the tests are done independent of their visits to the clinical testing center (CTC).\n\nList of recommended tests for upload:\n\nTests recommended from previous year:\nHbA1C%, tota cholesterol, HDL, LDL, Triglycerides. ##### Tests recommended from the last 3 months: Creatinine, Glucose, CBC (WBC, RBC, Hemoglobin, Hematocrite, Platelets, MCV, MCH, MCHC, RDW, Mean Platelet Volume, Neutrophils%, Lymphocytes%, Monocytes%, Eosinophils%, Basophils%) ##### Tests without time recommendation: TSH, CRP, Albumin, Total Protein, Bilirubin, AST-GOT, ALT-GPT, GGT, Alkaline phosphatase, Sodium, Potassium, Chloride, Calcium, Phosphor, Uric acid, B12, Vitamin D, Folic acid and Ferritin.\n\n\n\n\nMeasurement protocol\n\nEvery blood/urine test has its own measurement protocol. * Some blood tests require the participant itself to act differently prior to the test - whether it’s fasting, drinking concentrated glucose/lactose, sampling urine etc. * The technician has also a large part of the test, by selecting relevant buffers for every one of the tests and have it’s own complete protocol per test. * And the lab - each HMO would have their own storing protocols, measuring with different machines with different sensitivity thresholds and their own standards (usually aligned between different HMO, but not necessarily).\n\n\nData availability\n\nThe information is stored in 1 parquet file blood_tests.parquet.\n\n\nSummary of available data\n\nAll the participant provided blood tests are stored in a single .parquet file. Each row depicts a single test done (either blood or urine) for an individual. It consists of the test’s name, unit, date and value (split into 2 columns - continuous and categorical) with some extra metadata columns.\nThe duplicate value columns are an artifact of some tests having both float variables and notes from the HMOs instead of continuous values. We represent these notes as categorical values such as “value under detectable threshold” or “toxic levels” etc (e.g. urine microalbumin mostly contains float values, but it can also have “threshold under 3mg/l” in the categorical column). These notes are not values per-se, and replacing them with continuous values is not straightforward but they should be considered nonetheless.\n\n\nRelevant links\n\nPheno Data Browser\n\n\nfrom pheno_utils import PhenoLoader\n\n\npl = PhenoLoader('blood_tests')\npl\n\nPhenoLoader for blood_tests with\n67 fields\n2 tables: ['blood_tests', 'age_sex']\n\n\n\n\nData dictionary\n\npl.dict\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfolder_id\nfeature_set\nfield_string\ndescription_string\nrelative_location\nbulk_dictionary\nfield_type\ndata_coding\nstability\nunits\nsampling_rate\nbulk_file_extension\nstrata\nsexed\narray\ndebut\ncompleted\ntransformation\nlist_of_tags\npandas_dtype\n\n\ntabular_field_name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhmo\n16\nblood_tests\nHMO\nOne of 4 Isreali HMOs\nblood_tests/blood_tests.parquet\nNaN\nCategorical (single)\nNaN\nAccruing\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nPrimary\nBoth sexes\nSingle\n2015-01-01\nNaN\nNaN\nBlood Tests\ncategory\n\n\ncollection_date\n16\nblood_tests\nCollection date\nCollection date\nblood_tests/blood_tests.parquet\nNaN\nDate\nNaN\nAccruing\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nAuxiliary\nBoth sexes\nSingle\n2015-01-01\nNaN\nNaN\nBlood Tests\ndatetime64[ns]\n\n\nbt__albumin_float_value\n16\nblood_tests\nBlood test -

    "text": "Description\nPsychological and social health data captures mental well-being, emotional states, social connections, and life satisfaction across multiple domains. This includes measures of mood, anxiety, depression, social support networks, and satisfaction with various life aspects. Understanding psychological and social health is crucial as these factors significantly influence physical health outcomes, disease progression, and overall quality of life.\n\n\nIntroduction\nThe Human Phenotype Project conducts comprehensive data collection through online surveys, where participants voluntarily provide information on various aspects influencing their health. This includes information about psychological and social health factors, captured through two lifestyle surveys.\n\n\nMeasurement protocol\n\nThese lifestyle surveys are modeled after the UK Biobank’s touch screen questionnaire. Participants receive the full version via email to complete on the Zoho platform, either before or after their baseline visit. A shorter, follow-up version of the questionnaire is then filled out by participants during subsequent visits.\n\n\nData availability\n\nThe information is stored in 1 parquet file: psychological_and_social_health\n\n\nSummary of available data\n\nThe dataset includes comprehensive psychological and social health measures across several domains:\nSocial Connections: - Frequency

    "text": "Description\nThe HPP Olink dataset contains relative protein expression profiles for thousands of proteins measured in plasma from HPP participants, using Olink Reveal, an NGS‑based Proximity Extension Assay (PEA) platform. Each assay uses pairs of antibodies coupled to DNA oligos: when both antibodies bind the same protein, their oligos come into proximity, are extended, PCR‑amplified, and quantified via Illumina sequencing (Multiplex high-throughput proteomics with exceptional analytical specificity | illumina in collaboration with Olink, Wik, Lotta, et al, 2021).\nThe primary quantitative output is NPX (Normalized Protein eXpression), a log₂‑scaled, normalized value per protein, per sample. NPX is relative, not absolute concentration; within an assay, differences in NPX can be treated as relative fold changes (ΔNPX ≈ log₂ fold change).\n\n\nIntroduction\nThe Human Phenotype Project (HPP) aims to deeply characterize participants using multi‑omics, imaging, physiology, and longitudinal follow‑up. Proteins are proximal effectors of genes and often more closely related to disease biology than the genome alone; high‑plex proteomics adds dynamic information about inflammation, metabolism, tissue damage and signaling.\nOlink Reveal was chosen as the first large‑scale proteomics platform for HPP because it: - Provides &gt;1,000 proteins per sample from small volumes of plasma (Olink data normalization white paper | Olink). - Has a robust QC and normalization framework (internal/external controls, NPX, inter‑plate normalization). - Integrates naturally with Illumina NGS, allowing alignment with existing infrastructure and expertise.\n\n\nMeasurement protocol\n\nLab equipment\nSample prep: Automated pipetting using Tecan robots.\nSequencing: Illumina NovaSeq 6000, generating paired‑end NGS reads that encode PEA probe counts per assay.\n\n\nControls and plate layout\nPer the HPP Olink design and Olink recommendations: - Internal controls (spiked into each sample) designed to monitor the three main steps of the Olink protocol: Immunoreaction, extension, and amplification/detection (Figure 1). * Incubation Control 1 & 2: monitor overall reaction / matrix effects. * Extension Control: monitors extension + amplification/detection, used for within‑sample normalization. * Detection Control: monitors amplification/detection only. - External controls (dedicated wells per plate, Figure 2) * Inter‑Plate Controls (IPC, triplicates): synthetic high‑signal samples used for inter‑plate normalization. * Negative Controls (triplicates): buffer only; used to monitor background and define LOD. * Sample controls (pooled plasma, duplicates): monitor intra‑/inter‑assay CV across plates. - Randomization * Within each batch, samples are balanced and randomized for age, sex, and other key HPP covariates, so that plate medians are comparable and intensity normalization remains valid.\n\n\n\nolink internal controls\n\n\n\n\n\nolink external controls\n\n\n\n\nTechnology & NPX scale\n\nOlink Reveal platform\n\nReveal is an NGS‑based proteomics solution built on Olink’s PEA technology, measuring ~1,000 proteins per sample from ~4–25 μL plasma/serum (Olink Reveal: Revolutionizing High-Throughput Proteomics | Protavio Team).\nPanels are curated to cover cardiometabolic, inflammatory, neurology, oncology and other key pathways with broad proteome coverage.\n\n\n\nNPX computation (conceptual)\nFor qPCR‑based Olink platforms, NPX is derived from Ct values using: 1. Extension control normalization (ΔCt vs extension control). 2. IPC normalization (ΔΔCt vs IPC). 3. Panel‑specific correction factor to orient the scale so that higher NPX = higher protein abundance and background ≈ 0.\nFor NGS‑based platforms (Reveal/Explore), the exact calculations differ, but NPX retains the same conceptual properties: 1. Log₂‑like unit, relative per assay. 2. Roughly: ΔNPX = 1 → ~2× fold change (What Does the Olink NPX Value Represent? Guidelines for Accurate Interpretation of Protein Expression Data | MtoZ Biolabs Services)\nInterpretation guidelines - Compare NPX within the same assay (e.g., IL‑6 across individuals or timepoints), not across different proteins. - Cross‑run / cross‑plate comparisons are valid after the specified normalization steps (IPC/intensity + any bridge normalization).\n\n\n\n\nData availability\n\n\nRaw NGS output (Illumina BCL)\n\nOne BCL directory per sequencing run.\n\nBCL detection & validation (Dagster)\n\nAuto‑detect runs under /day2data/illumina/.\nValidate BCL structure, presence of RunInfo, sample sheet, and Olink recipe files.\n\nBCL → counts (ngs2counts, Olink propraietary SW)\n\nRun in Docker; outputs assay‑level count matrices per run/plate.\n\nCounts → NPX (npx_map_cli, Olink propraietary SW)\n\nVendor npx_map_cli tool converts counts + plate metadata into NPX tables, with vendor QC flags and internal/external control information.\n\nPheno QC pipeline\n\nApply sample/assay QC filters.\nRemove failed run and per‑run assay QC warnings.\nPCA + median–IQR outlier detection.\nIntraCV/interCV‑based filtering of noisy assays.\nBridge normalization for outlier run(s)\nLOD analysis and % below LOD summaries.\n\nFinal dataset assembly - temporary location: s3://datasets-development/olink/dataset/ in the DS account\n\nLong‑format NPX tables with all QC columns + LOD (5_olink_npx_data_lod_added.parquet)\nExternal controls with all QC columns (no LOD) (4_olink_npx_controls_cv_qc.parquet)\nLOD per assay (protein) information (5_olink_lod_per_assay.parquet)\n\nResearch stage filling - temporary location: s3://ds-users/anat/olink_eda/\n\nolink_npx_events_filled_multiindex.parquet - dataset after filling missing research stages and adding PhenoLoader-compatible multi-index (['participant_id', 'cohort', 'research_stage', 'array_index'])",

    "text": "Description\nThis dataset includes comprehensive gait, balance, and movement measurements collected using the Newton VR Ltd. motion capture system. The testing protocol comprises seven distinct assessments conducted over approximately 7 minutes: baseline A-pose, self-selected gait speed, treadmill walking at constant speed (3 km/h), stationary walking, sit-to-stand strength test, and Romberg balance tests (eyes open and closed). Movement parameters are captured through RGB, infrared, and depth-sensing cameras positioned at multiple angles, providing detailed analysis of participants’ gait patterns, balance capabilities, and functional movement.\n\n\nIntroduction\nGait and balance assessments are critical indicators of overall health, functional capacity, and fall risk, particularly in middle-aged and older adults. Abnormal gait patterns can be early indicators of neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson’s disease, dementia, and multiple sclerosis, as well as musculoskeletal and cardiovascular conditions. Gait speed has been validated as a reliable predictor of survival, hospitalization, and functional decline, often referred to as the “sixth vital sign.”\nThe sit-to-stand test measures lower limb strength and functional endurance, reflecting overall mobility and independence in activities of daily living. The Romberg test assesses proprioception and vestibular function, providing insight into neurological health and postural control. Balance impairments are strongly associated with increased fall risk, representing a major public health concern.\nThe participants’ gait, balance, and movement parameters are analyzed as biomarkers at Newton VR Ltd.’s Gait and Movement Laboratory. Advanced algorithms analyze multi-camera recordings to produce comprehensive movement biomarkers that can be used to track health outcomes and identify subtle changes that may precede clinical manifestations of disease.\n\n\nMeasurement protocol\n\nThe gait and balance testing is conducted by trained operators using the Newton VR Ltd. system within a dedicated movement laboratory at the Clinical Testing Center.

    "text": "Description\nA CBC (complete blood count) test is a common blood test that measures the number and size of different blood cells in a sample of blood. It can be used to diagnose a wide range of medical conditions, such as anemia, infection, and leukemia, as well as to monitor the body’s response to treatment. A CBC test can also indicate overall health status, helping to detect certain medical conditions before they manifest clinically.\n\n\nIntroduction\nThe DxH 560 is a quantitative, multi-parameter, automated hematology analyzer used for complete blood count (CBC). It is widely used in clinical settings for the analysis of various components of blood, such as red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. The DxH 560 machine provides a fast, reliable and accurate way of measuring the different cell types and analytes in the blood sample.\nIn the clinical setting, CBC can be used in a variety of ways. For example, changes in the white blood cell count can indicate an infection or inflammation, while changes in the red blood cell count can indicate anemia or other blood disorders. Additionally, this machine can be used to measure platelet count and hemoglobin level, which could indicate bleeding, clotting or hematologic issues. The CBC data can also be used to monitor treatment efficacy in conditions such as leukemia, where changes in cell counts can be used to track the progression of the disease. Furthermore, this data can be used in preventative screenings and routine check-ups to keep track of a patient’s health status. Overall, the data collected by the DxH 560 provides a comprehensive picture of a patient’s blood cell profile, which is an essential tool for diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of various medical conditions.\nThe Human Phenotype Project includes collection of blood samples for CBC during every visit to the testing center including baseline and follow up visits. Blood is collected in non-fasting condition.\nManufacturer reference study:\nA reference interval study was conducted to assess the reference intervals for the DxH 560. Whole blood samples were collected from at least 240 healthy adult donors aged 22 to 65 years (males and females). Reference intervals were verified for males and females up to 65 years of age.\n\n\nMeasurement protocol\n\nThe blood is drawn from the arm vein (venous blood). The usual place for a sample to be taken is the inside of the elbow or wrist (antecubital fossa), where the veins are relatively close to the surface.\nCollection Details: - A total of approximately 16 ml of blood is collected in 3 tubes of which CBC is 3 ml - Fasting is not required for this blood test - CBC and PBMC tubes are kept at room temperature until processing (up to 2 hours) - CBC is collected in EDTA tubes (purple top) - At the end of the shift, all the samples are taken to be processed by the DxH 560 machine\n\n\nData availability\n\nThe CBC blood tests consist of 21 tests comprising of both red blood cells and white blood cells statistics outputed by the DxH560 machine.\nThe tests are described in the CBC blood tests data dictionary.\nQuality Control:\nEach day, the machine undergoes a validation process including 3 control samples denoted by low, normal and high. If the results are consistent (up to some acceptable variance) with their known values, the testing continues for the day. Their data is available for download, but it’s not a streamlined process yet.\n\n\nSummary of available data\n\nThe CBC blood tests consist of 21 tests comprising of both red blood cells and white blood cells statistics outputed by the DxH560 machine. These measurements provide comprehensive information about:\n\nRed blood cell parameters: Count, hemoglobin levels, hematocrit, and various red blood cell indices\nWhite blood cell parameters: Total count and differential counts of various white blood cell types\nPlatelet parameters: Count and related metrics\n\nThe data is collected at every visit to the testing center, including baseline and follow-up visits, providing longitudinal tracking of blood cell profiles over time.",

    "text": "Description\nThe Children Dataset is a curated collection of self-reported information from participants concerning their children and pregnancy experiences. It includes key variables such as:\n\nNumber of Children: The total count of biological children reported by each participant.\nBirth Weights: Recorded birth weights of participants’ children, offering insights into neonatal health and potential risk factors.\nPregnancy Durations: Length of each pregnancy in weeks, indicating whether births were full-term or preterm\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nThe Human Phenotype Project collects comprehensive data about participants’ children and pregnancy experiences, as these factors can provide important insights into maternal and paternal health, genetic influences, and intergenerational health patterns. Birth weight and pregnancy duration are key indicators of fetal development and maternal health during pregnancy, and can be associated with long-term health outcomes for both parents and children. This information also enables research into the heritability of traits and conditions, as well as the impact of parental phenotypes on offspring health. By collecting data on number of pregnancies, genetic testing before pregnancy, and detailed birth outcomes for multiple children, researchers can investigate patterns across families and explore how parental characteristics and environmental factors influence reproductive outcomes.\n\n\nMeasurement protocol\n\nData for the Children Dataset were collected during the registration phase of the Human Phenotype Project through the Initial Medical Survey. Participants completed an online questionnaire designed to capture accurate and comprehensive information\n\n\nData availability\n\nThe information is stored in 1 parquets file: children.parquet\n\n\nSummary of available data\n\nThe dataset includes detailed information about participants’ reproductive history and their children:\nPregnancy History: - Total number of pregnancies - Number of biological children - History of genetic testing before pregnancy\nBirth Outcomes (for up to 9 children): - Birth week (gestational age at delivery) - Birth weight in kilograms - Collection date and timezone\nThis data enables research into: 1. Associations between parental phenotypes and birth outcomes 2. Patterns of pregnancy duration and birth weight across multiple children within families 3. Intergenerational health relationships 4.

    "text": "Description\nThe collection of buccal swabs for human genetic sequencing presents an advantageous opportunity to simultaneously explore the oral microbiome using the non-human DNA sequences found. This metagenomic analysis provides insight into the diverse microbial community within the buccal mucosa. The obtained data not only enriches our genetic understanding but also broadens our knowledge on the microorganisms residing in the oral cavity, their interactions, and potential implications for oral and systemic health. This dual analysis underscores the utility of buccal swabs as a resourceful means for both genetic and microbial investigations.\n\n\nIntroduction\nThe primary intent behind collecting buccal swabs was to explore human genetics. Concurrently, it yielded metagenomic data, unveiling the microbial community within the oral cavity.\nThis data illuminates the diversity and interactions of microorganisms, specifically in the buccal mucosa. Delving into the oral microbiome presents an opportunity to understand its linkage to health conditions. For instance, an imbalanced oral microbiome can lead to periodontal disease, associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. Moreover, alterations in the oral microbiome have been observed in oral cancers, hinting at its potential role in their onset and progression​ The oral microbiome: diversity, biogeography and human health​.\nThrough this data, the exploration into possible connections between oral microbial composition and various health conditions is facilitated, marking a step towards understanding the broader health implications.\n\n\nMeasurement protocol\n\nThis dataset is a derivative of the human genome dataset (that has been collected via buccal swabs) -

    "text": "Description\nFundus imaging allows for the visualization of the interior surface of the eye, known as the fundus; and used to examine structures such as the optic disc, retina, and retinal microvasculature. This procedure is commonly used to diagnose and monitor a variety of eye diseases.\n\n\nIntroduction\nFundus imaging is a type of medical imaging technique that is used to obtain detailed, high-resolution images of the back of the eye, including the retina, the optic nerve, and the macula, an oval-shaped area in the center of the retina used for central vision (Figure 1). These images can provide important information about the health of the eye and can be used to diagnose and monitor a variety of eye diseases and conditions.\nOne of the key features that can be seen in fundus images is the retinal microvasculature, which refers to the network of small blood vessels that supply blood to the retina. The appearance and structure of the retinal microvasculature can provide information about the health of the eye and can be used to diagnose and monitor a variety of conditions.\nIn addition, the information provided by fundus imaging can also be used in research to better understand the underlying mechanisms of various eye conditions and as a non-invasive tool for visualization of the general microvascular circulation health and a direct view to part of the central nervous system. As such, the fundus image can serve as a window to systemic health.\nThe Human Phenotype Project (HPP) performs fundus imaging on each participant’s eyes to produce image and DICOM files. To process and enhance the data, an open source software pipeline: AutoMorph: Automated Retinal Vascular Morphology Quantification via a Deep Learning Pipeline (Zhou 2022), that combines several different deep learning models is used. Specifically for the following steps: (1) Image pre-processing. (2) Image quality grading. (3) Anatomical segmentation (binary vessel segmentation, artery/vein segmentation, and optic disc segmentation). (4) Various morphological feature measurements such as vessel caliber, tortuosity density, fractal dimension etc. These features were calculated separately for segmented veins and arteries, and also as a combined feature. The current pipeline does not include automatic identification or clinical interpretation of eye abnormalities such as age-macular degeneration (AMD) or edema, glaucoma signs, microaneurysms etc’ that can be derived from the fundus image.\n\n\nMeasurement protocol\n\nImages of both eyes were taken with the iCare DRSplus confocal fundus imaging system (ICare). Center view 45° retinal images were collected without pupil dilation.\n\n\n\nDRSplus confocal fundus imaging system\n\n\n\n\nData availability\n\n\nAll tabular information is stored in a main parquet file: fundus.parquet\nDerived microvasculature information is stored in a secondary parquet file: microvasculature.parquet\nImage files including segmentations are stored in subfolders and mapped in the parqet files.\n\n\n\nSummary of available data\n\n\nFundus image files.\nSegmented images of vessels, veins, arteries.\nImage quality scores and auxiliary data fields.\nExtracted retinal

    "text": "Description\nA medical conditions dataset is a collection of information about various health-related issues experienced by people. This data can include symptoms, diagnoses, treatments, and outcomes for different diseases and conditions. The dataset is gathered using various methods, or “modalities,” such as electronic health records, surveys, wearable devices, and medical imaging. The purpose of collecting and analyzing this information is to better understand health trends, identify risk factors, and improve medical care for everyone.\n\n\nIntroduction\nMedical diagnosis in research studies plays a crucial role in the understanding and advancement of medicine. In clinical research, the process of diagnosis is used to identify individuals with specific medical conditions and to determine the prevalence of these conditions within a study population. Diagnosis is also used to identify subgroups of individuals with similar characteristics or outcomes, which can help researchers to better understand the underlying disease mechanisms and to develop risk models, identify biomarkers for early detection of the disease and for monitoring its progress and to develop new treatments.\nSurvey data is a valuable resource for understanding various aspects of medical conditions. It involves collecting self-reported information from individuals about their health, symptoms, diagnoses, treatments, and lifestyle factors. This data is tabular, meaning it is organized in rows and columns, which makes it easy to analyze and compare.\nMedical conditions data collected through surveys covers diverse body systems, such as the cardiovascular, respiratory, digestive, and nervous systems. It provides insights into disease prevalence, risk factors, and the impact on individuals’ lives.\nSurveys are an attractive data modality due to their accessibility, cost-effectiveness, and ability to capture patient perspectives. This information helps researchers identify potential risk factors, inform prevention strategies, and shape public health policies, ultimately contributing to better health outcomes for diverse populations.\n\n\nMeasurement protocol\n\nUpon registration to the Human Phenotype Project study, participants provide details about their medical conditions in the Initial Medical Survey. Further data is then gathered during an interview at the baseline visit (In-system drop down) and using the Follow-up Medical Survey when participants return for subsequent visits. The data source columns indicate where information was collected.\nQuestions and self-reported medical diagnoses were mapped to ICD-11 codes. Medical diagnoses at baseline were determined as diagnoses that were reported at the baseline visit or with an onset date prior to the baseline visit.\n\nBaseline\n\nParticipants fill in medical conditions history in the Initial Medical Survey.\nInterviewer asks participant question and fill in a drop down list of different conditions participants have (In-system drop down).\n\n\n\nEvery follow up visit/ call and baseline\n\nFollow-up Medical Survey -\n\nMedical questionnaire asks about conditions.\nShould fill in the date when new condition was founded .\n\n\n\n\n\nData availability\n\nThe information is stored in 1 parquet file: medical_conditions.parquet\n\n\nSummary of available data\n\n\nMedical conditions of participants at various research stages.\n\n\n\nRelevant links\n\nPheno Data Browser\n\n\nfrom pheno_utils import PhenoLoader\n\n\npl = PhenoLoader('medical_conditions')\npl\n\nPhenoLoader for medical_conditions with\n12 fields\n2 tables: ['medical_conditions', 'age_sex']\n\n\n\n\nData dictionary\n\npl.dict\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfield_string\ndescription_string\nfolder_id\nfeature_set\nfield_type\nstrata\ndata_coding\narray\npandas_dtype\nbulk_file_extension\nrelative_location\nunits\nbulk_dictionary\nsampling_rate\ntransformation\nlist_of_tags\nstability\nsexed\ndebut\ncompleted\n\n\ntabular_field_name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmedical_condition\nMedical condition name\nMedical condition name\n21\nmedical_conditions\nText\nPrimary\nNaN\nMultiple\nstring\nNaN\nmedical_conditions/medical_conditions.parquet\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nAccruing\nBoth sexes\n11/21/2018\nNaN\n\n\nicd11_code\nICD11 code\nICD-11 codes are the latest global system for ...\n21\nmedical_conditions\nText\nPrimary\nNaN\nMultiple\nstring\nNaN\nmedical_conditions/medical_conditions.parquet\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nAccruing\nBoth sexes\n11/21/2018\nNaN\n\n\ndata_source\nData source of medical condition\nData source the self reporting of medical cond...\n21\nmedical_conditions\nText\nPrimary\nNaN\nMultiple\nstring\nNaN\nmedical_conditions/medical_conditions.parquet\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nAccruing\nBoth sexes\n11/21/2018\nNaN\n\n\nstart_month\nStart month\nStart month\n21\nmedical_conditions\nInteger\nPrimary\nNaN\nMultiple\nint\nNaN\nmedical_conditions/medical_conditions.parquet\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nAccruing\nBoth sexes\n11/21/2018\nNaN\n\n\nstart_year\nStart year\nStart year\n21\nmedical_conditions\nInteger\nPrimary\nNaN\nMultiple\nint\nNaN\nmedical_conditions/medical_conditions.parquet\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nAccruing\nBoth sexes\n11/21/2018\nNaN\n\n\nend_month\nEnd month\nStart month\n21\nmedical_conditions\nInteger\nPrimary\nNaN\nMultiple\nint\nNaN\nmedical_conditions/medical_conditions.parquet\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nAccruing\nBoth sexes\n11/21/2018\nNaN\n\n\nend_year\nStart year\nStart year\n21\nmedical_conditions\nInteger\nPrimary\nNaN\nMultiple\nint\nNaN\nmedical_conditions/medical_conditions.parquet\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nAccruing\nBoth sexes\n11/21/2018\nNaN\n\n\ncollection_timestamp\nCollection time\nCollection time\n21\nmedical_conditions\nDatetime\nCollection time\nNaN\nSingle\ndatetime64[ns, Asia/Jerusalem]\nNaN\nmedical_conditions/medical_conditions.parquet\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nAccruing\nBoth sexes\n11/21/2018\nNaN\n\n\ncollection_date\nCollection date\nCollection date\n21\nmedical_conditions\nDate\nCollection time\nNaN\nSingle\ndatetime64[ns]\nNaN\nmedical_conditions/medical_conditions.parquet\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nAccruing\nBoth sexes\n11/21/2018\nNaN\n\n\ntimezone\nTimezone\nTimezone\n21\nmedical_conditions\nCategorical (single)\nCollection time\nNaN\nSingle\ncategory\nNaN\nmedical_conditions/medical_conditions.parquet\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nAccruing\nBoth sexes\n11/21/2018\nNaN",

This data includes subjective descriptions such as pain levels, fatigue, and other discomforts, along with observed signs like fever or swelling. Tracking symptoms over time helps in identifying potential health issues, understanding disease onset and progression, and supporting diagnosis. It provides valuable real-time insights into patient well-being and is crucial for personalized healthcare management and treatment planning.\n\n\nIntroduction\nThe Human Phenotype Project study collects medical data through online surveys, where participants self-report their experiences with various medical symptoms. This method depends on individuals accurately conveying their own health experiences. Obtaining detailed and thorough information about the symptoms people experience is essential to understand their actual impact on individual health.\n\n\nMeasurement protocol\n\nIn the initial phase of the study, during registration, participants are asked to provide information about any medical symptoms they have experienced in the Initial Medical Survey. Additional data is then collected in the Follow-up UKBB Survey during subsequent visits, allowing for ongoing tracking of these symptoms\nAn additional survey is asked to participants focusing on Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) and digestive health. This digestive health survey is an adaptation of the UK Biobank online gastro-intestinal health self-assessment questionnaire. Many of the questions in the UK Biobank gut health (IBS) questionnaire were adopted from the World Gastroenterology Association questionnaire (2009). Questions asked are related to the participant’s bowel habits, characterization of abdominal pain patterns, accompanying symptoms, and history of IBS in the family.\n\n\nData availability\n\nThe information is stored in 3 parquest files: initial_medical.parquet, follow_up_ukbb.parquet and digestve_health.parquet\n\n\nSummary of available data\n\n\nInitial Medical Survey: A DataFrame containing tabular features representing responses related to medical symptoms from the initial medical survey.\nLifestyle Survey: A DataFrame containing tabular features representing responses

    "text": "Description\nBone density was profiled based on DXA imaging, and includes measurements of mineral content in different parts of a variety of skeletal components.\n\n\nIntroduction\nDXA (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry) imaging is a method used to measure bone density and mineral content. A DXA scan uses a low dose of ionizing radiation to produce a detailed image of the body, specifically the bones. The scan is then analyzed by a software to determine the bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC) in different parts of the body. This method is considered to be one of the most accurate methods for measuring bone density, as it is able to provide detailed information about the distribution of bone mineral content in different bony structures of the body skeleton. The spine and hip are most commonly measured because that is where most osteoporotic fractures occur. DXA imaging is commonly used for assessing the risk of osteoporosis, a condition characterized by low bone density and increased risk of fractures, and for monitoring the effects of treatments for the condition.\n\n\nMeasurement protocol\n\nDual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) was performed with the GE Lunar Prodigy Advance device (GE Healthcare, USA) and the GE CoreScan and OneScan software applications. Before the scan, participants were asked to remove all metal items, heavy clothing and shoes. Bone mineral density was measured from the Femur necks, bilaterally and from the spine vertebra L1-L4. The Spine and femur imaging was performed with the OneScan, which performs an anterior posterior (AP) Spine and the dual femur exam without repositioning between scans. Participants were placed on the scanner bed with legs internally rotated and secured using a foot brace. The AP Spine measurement and analysis provides an estimate of bone mineral density for the lumbar spine while the Dual Femur measurement measures the density in the proximal femurs (femur neck). These values can then be compared to reference populations providing Z-scores that are matched for age, sex and ethnicity; and T-scores which indicate how many standard deviations a patient’s value is from the mean value of a healthy Young Adult reference population (NHANES).\n\n\n\nDXA\n\n\n\n\nData availability\n\nThe information is stored in 1 parquet file: bone_density.parquet\n\n\nSummary of

Lipidomics is a subfield of metabolomics, which is defined as the study of pathways and networks of cellular lipids in biological systems. Lipids perform various functions within the body, from structural components of cell membranes, to energy reserve and regulating hormones. These pivotal functions highlight circulating lipids as playing a key role in a number of age-related diseases such as cardiovascular disease and stroke (Holmes et al. 2018; Michos et al. 2019).\n\n\nMeasurement protocol\n\nThe data acquisition process can be broken down into these three main stages: 1. Sample preparation and experimental design, performed by the wet lab at Weizmann 2. Operating the MS machines to obtain the raw spectral data, performed by the Weizmann service unit 3. Processing the raw spectral data to obtain the final format for research, performed by the computational lab at Weizmann\n\nSample preparation and experimental design\nThe process starts with drawing blood from the participants during their visit to the assessment center (see Sample inventory for details). Serum is extracted from the sample and is aliquoted into 5 smaller tubes. All the barcodes mapping are currently documented in the LabCollector. The team at the wet lab performs the sample preparation and samples are arranged in working plates of size 96. Every plate contains 92 samples from study participants, and 4 QC samples that will be used for systematic bias correction. The QC includes two types: 1. Empty well for blank (position 93 in the plate) 2. Anchor sample - this is a sample that was pooled from a large number of study participants, and is used as validation for the statistical correction methods. Same sample is used repeatedly. (position 94 in the plate) 3. Two NIST samples - these are standardized technical replicates that contain a predefined mixture of human serum metabolites. These samples are later used for running order and batch correction of the data. (positions 95-96 in the plate)\nFor every plate, the team at the wet lab produces an experimental design file that describes the layout for the analysis of the plate. Mainly, it describes the ordering of the samples to be injected into the MS machine, including the various sample types (HPP, empty, NIST, anchor), the tube barcode, their quantity and location. Systematic removal of technical noise is partly performed based on this experimental design file.\n\n\nOperating the MS machines to obtain the raw spectral data\nThe service unit in Weizmann is responsible to operate the MS machines in order to profile the samples. According to the service unit staff, initial QC checks are performed after the injection of every plate, making sure that internal standards are identifiable, and that the sensitivity of the MS machine is within reasonable limits.\n\n\nProcessing the raw spectral data to obtain the final format for research\nLipid annotations were obtained by comparing the mz, retention times and ccs values to equivalent empirical measurements from a library that was profiled on the same instruments with longer running times (26 minutes).\n\n\n\nData availability\n\nThe information is stored in 1 parquet file: serum_lipidomics.parquet\n\n\nSummary of available data\n\n\nRaw spectral data per sample in open source format (mzML).\nAll features of processed data (systematic error removed, batch corrected, plates merged).\nAnnotated processed features.\nClustered processed features.\n\n\n\nRelevant links\n\nPheno Data Browser\n\n\nfrom pheno_utils import PhenoLoader\n\n\npl =

    "text": "Description\nBlood pressure is the measurement of the force exerted against the walls of the arteries as blood flows through them. Blood pressure is recorded as two values: systolic pressure (the maximum arterial pressure during left ventricular contraction) and diastolic pressure (the minimum arterial pressure during left ventricular relaxation).\n\n\nIntroduction\nHypertension, or elevated blood pressure, is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease and cerebrovascular events, contributing substantially to global mortality and morbidity. Chronic hypertension is characterized by persistently elevated arterial pressure, which increases cardiac workload and can lead to cardiovascular complications. Conversely, hypotension, or abnormally low blood pressure, can be equally detrimental. Severe hypotension may result in inadequate perfusion of vital organs, potentially leading to insufficient oxygen and nutrient delivery, and in extreme cases, progressing to circulatory shock, a life-threatening condition.\nBlood pressure measurement can be performed in a variety of settings, including hospitals, clinics, and even at home, using an automated or manual sphygmomanometer. Blood pressure measurement can be used to monitor the effectiveness of treatment interventions, such as lifestyle changes. The goal of treatment is to achieve and maintain target blood pressure levels, which are generally lower for individuals at higher risk for cardiovascular disease.\n\n\nMeasurement protocol\n\nBlood pressure is measured using an OMRON Blood Pressure Monitor HEM-RML31 device and an appropriately sized cuff. Multiple blood pressure readings are done during the visit. For each blood pressure reading, three measurements are taken: systolic pressure, diastolic pressure, and average heart rate. The participant is asked to avoid caffeine, exercise and smoking at least 30 minutes before the measurement. The measurement is taken on the left arm if possible. The cuff size is based on the arm circumference.\nThe participant is seated for 5 minutes, after which the first measurement is taken. Repeat a second measurement after 2 minutes. The participant then lies down for 5 minutes and the lying blood pressure reading is taken. The participant then stands up, slowly. The first standing reading is taken after 1 minute of standing and the next reading after 3 minutes of standing. The participant is asked to report about dizziness on standing up.\n\n\n\nimage alt\n\n\n\n\nData availability\n\nThe information is stored in 1 parquet file: blood_pressure.parquet\n\n\nSummary of

    "text": "Description\nThe RNA-Seq dataset includes bulk gene expression profiles measured in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) cells, sampled at each visit to the clinical testing center.\n\n\nIntroduction\n\nRNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) is a powerful high-throughput technique used to analyze the transcriptome, providing a snapshot of RNA presence and quantity in a biological sample at a given moment. Our bulk approach sequences RNA from a mixed population of cells, giving a cumulative overview of gene expression across the sample. It’s widely used for understanding complex biological processes and disease mechanisms.\nThis RNA-Seq dataset focuses on gene expression profiles in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), collected during patient visits to a clinical testing center. The aim is to uncover the gene expression dynamics in PBMCs under various clinical conditions. PBMCs, which include lymphocytes and monocytes, play a key role in the immune response. The gene expression patterns in these cells can provide valuable insights into immune system activities and pathophysiological states.\nThe dataset was generated using 3’-tagged bulk RNA sequencing technology, capturing a broad spectrum of gene expression in PBMCs from diverse clinical samples. This protocol was adapted from the mcSCRB-seq protocol (Bagnoli et al.). This method incorporates unique molecular identifiers (UMIs), sample multiplexing (Figure 1). UMIs are crucial for accurately quantifying transcript abundance, as they enable the differentiation of PCR duplicates from unique mRNA molecules. Pool barcodes facilitate multiplexing of several samples in a single sequencing run, enhancing throughput efficiency. Sample barcodes are used to track individual samples, ensuring precise sample identification.\nThe dataset is instrumental for research in immunology and systemic diseases, offering a unique perspective on how PBMC gene expression varies in different clinical scenarios. It serves as a critical resource for understanding immune responses and developing therapeutic strategies.\n\n\nMeasurement protocol\n\n\nSample Collection and Storage\nPeripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected from human participants following established standard operating procedures. Blood samples were drawn at the Clinical Testing Center (CTC), with three tubes per participant (Complete Blood Count (CBC), serum, and PBMC isolation). The PBMC samples were processed within 2 hours of collection, where centrifugation was performed to separate the mononuclear layer.\nAfter isolation, PBMCs were aliquoted into three tubes per sample. For the purpose of RNA sequencing, one aliquot was stored at -80°C, preserving RNA integrity for downstream analysis. The viability and concentration of PBMCs were assessed using an automated cell counter, ensuring a high quality of the isolated cells for downstream processing.\n\n\nRNA Extraction and Library Preparation\nRNA was extracted from the PBMC samples using a standard protocol. During reverse transcription, Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs), sample barcodes, PCR primers, and ERCC spike-ins were added to each sample. The ERCC spike-ins serve as external controls for quantifying and normalizing gene expression data, ensuring accurate transcript measurements.\nAfter reverse transcription, the cDNA was subject to initial amplification to increase the quantity of material available for library preparation. A cutting enzyme (TDE1, or Nextera transposase prior to May 2023) was then introduced to fragment the cDNA and add sequencing adaptors through tagmentation.\nFollowing fragmentation, samples were pooled, and a final round of PCR amplification was performed to complete the library, preparing it for sequencing.\n\n\nSequencing\nThe prepared RNA libraries were sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq platform with an average read depth of 5 million reads per sample. Read 1 (R1) is 20 base pairs (bp) long (after removing the sample barcode) and contains the UMI and poly-T tail. Read 2 (R2) is 66bp long and contains the cDNA and possibly poly-A tail. PhiX control libraries were spiked into the sequencing runs to enhance sequence diversity. The sequencing generated high-quality 3’ RNA-seq data, suitable for downstream bioinformatic analysis.\n\n\n\nlibrary structure\n\n\nFigure 1: library structure\n\n\n\nData availability\n\n\nAll tabular information is stored in a main parquet file: rna_seq.parquet\nRead counts are stored in long-format parquet files per batch\nEach sequencing batch includes metadata parquet, JSON and HTML files\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR;\n\nS[sequencing] --&gt;|bcl2fastq&lt;br&gt;fastq-multx| raw(raw FASTQ) --&gt;|umi-tools&lt;br&gt;cutadapt| trimmed(trimmed FASTQ) --&gt;|STAR| aligned(aligned BAM) --&gt;|umi-tools| deduplicated(deduplicated BAM) --&gt;|htseq| counts(counts)\n\nraw --&gt; metadata(metadata)\ntrimmed --&gt; metadata\naligned --&gt; metadata\ndeduplicated --&gt; metadata\ncounts --&gt; metadata\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary of available data\n\n\nMetadata: statistics from the library preparation, QC metrics, ERCC spike-ins stats, and all processing steps of each sample, and each batch.

    "text": "Description\nDiet logging using a smartphone app involves collecting data on food and drink consumption through a mobile application. These data include information such as types of food, serving sizes, nutritional information and the times of consumption. The data is used to track dietary habits and can be used in scientific research to gain insights into the dietary habits of a population and to correlate to other temporal measurements and events.\n\n\nIntroduction\nThere is a strong relationship between the development of chronic disease and a person’s diet. Adults who eat a healthy diet are more likely to live longer and are less likely to develop chronic disease or become obese. An unhealthy diet is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and certain types of cancer. Consuming a nutrient-dense diet was associated with a low risk of all-cause mortality.\nNutritional epidemiology is a sub-discipline of epidemiology that provides data about the relationship between diet and disease. The data collected is used to define diet–disease associations that are converted into the practice of prevention by public-health nutrition practitioners. To study the associations between diet and disease, there is a need to accurately characterize the dietary habits of individuals. One approach is to use a food diary, which is a daily log of what an individual eats and drinks. Such diaries are used to characterize eating habits in large and small epidemiological studies. Owing to recent technological advancements and the vast availability of smartphones, nutrition-related apps are commonly used to track dietary behavior.\n\n\nMeasurement protocol\n\nParticipants in the Human Phenotype Project are asked to log their food for a period of at least two weeks following each visit to the assessment center or a followup call. The figure below shows the process of logging a food item through the diet logging app.\n\n\n\nimage alt\n\n\nParticipants are asked to download the app and start logging data one day before the visit to the assessment center. Participants are asked to log everything they eat and drink and to include as one “meal” all the items they have consumed within a 30 minute interval. While participants are asked to log their meals for at least 14 days after each visit, the logging app is open for the whole study period and participants are encouraged to document their diets beyond this time.\n\n\nData availability:\n\nThe information is stored in 3 parquet files: diet_logging.parquet, diet_logging_events.parquet, raw_diet_logging_events.parquetwhich contains summary information, processed diet logging data and raw diet logging data respectively.\n\n\nSummary of available data\n\n\nClean Diet Logging Data: A DataFrame with individual-level diet logging records, post-basic preprocessing and filtering.\nRaw Diet Logging Data: A DataFrame containing the raw, unprocessed individual-level diet logging records.\nNutrients: Nutritional information corresponding to the diet logging records.\nSummary Table: Contains summary statistics of the diet logging data, aggregated per participant per research stage.\n\n\n\nRelevant links\n\nPheno Data Browser\n\n\nfrom

Vocal biomarkers can be used for disease diagnosis (e.g., Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s), mental health assessment, and monitoring respiratory conditions. Voice features such as pitch, tone, and speech patterns can provide non-invasive, cost-effective insights into a person’s health status and disease progression.\nA vocal biomarker is a signature or feature from the audio signal of the voice that is associated with a clinical outcome and can be used to monitor patients, diagnose conditions, or assess disease severity. Work on vocal biomarkers has mainly been performed in neurodegenerative disorders (particularly Parkinson’s disease, where voice disorders occur in 70-80% of cases), mental health conditions, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease and mild cognitive impairment, cardiometabolic diseases, and respiratory conditions including COVID-19.\nVoice features extracted from audio recordings include:\n\nFundamental frequency (F0): Captures pitch and vocal fold vibration patterns\nFormants (F1-F3): Reflects vocal tract configuration and articulation precision\nHarmonics-to-Noise Ratio (HNR): Quantifies voice quality, breathiness, and roughness\nJitter and Shimmer: Measures cycle-to-cycle variation in pitch and amplitude\nMFCCs: Compact spectral descriptors aligned with human auditory perception\nProsody features: Speech rate, intensity, and intonation patterns\n\n\n\nMeasurement protocol\n\nParticipants provide a 30-second voice recording by counting to thirty in their native language (primarily Hebrew, with a subset in Japanese). Recordings are captured in a quiet, controlled clinical setting.\nRecording setup: - Device: Cardioid dynamic USB/XLR microphone - Software: Audacity (open-source audio recording/editing software) - Format: Lossless .flac format (preserves full audio fidelity) - Duration: ~30 seconds (counting 1-30) - Environment: Quiet, controlled clinical setting - Distance: Microphone positioned 15-30 cm from participant’s mouth - Accessories: Desktop mic stand, pop filter\nTechnical specifications: - Sampling rate: 44.1 kHz (default), supports up to 48 kHz - Bit depth: 16-bit / 24-bit - Frequency response: 50 Hz – 15 kHz - Polar pattern: Cardioid (unidirectional)\n\n\nData availability\n\nThe information is stored as individual audio files in .flac format (lossless compression), with associated participant metadata in .csv files. Each recording is approximately 30 seconds in duration.\n\n\nSummary of available data\n\nThe data comprises of multiple levels:\n\nRaw audio files: Lossless .flac audio recordings of participants counting to thirty in their native language\nExtracted features: Traditional signal processing features (F0, formants, jitter, shimmer, MFCCs) and deep learning-based embeddings for vocal biomarker research",

    "text": "Description\nThe Human Phenotype Project medications dataset is based on self-reported, participant-provided information. Self-reported medications are coded to Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) codes from the WHO Collaborating Centre for Drug Statistics Methodology. The ATC classification system is the gold standard for international drug utilization monitoring and research.\n\n\nIntroduction\nMedication usage reporting in medical research and longitudinal cohort studies is essential for understanding drug effectiveness, safety, and biological interactions. Medication usage data helps researchers understand how different medications affect diverse populations and organ systems based on genetics, environment, lifestyle, and medical history. For example, an individual’s microbiome composition can influence drug metabolism and absorption, while the drugs themselves can alter microbiome populations. Drug-drug interactions represent another critical factor that can affect treatment efficacy.\nMultiple methods exist for collecting medication usage data in research studies, including self-report, medical records, pill counts, and electronic monitoring. Self-report involves participants directly reporting their medication use to researchers. Accurate and complete medication data is essential for understanding the true impact of pharmaceuticals on individual health.\nThe Human Phenotype Project collects medication information through self-reporting via online and smartphone applications, as well as through staff-administered questionnaires during telephone or in-person follow-up visits.\n\n\nMeasurement protocol\n\nMedication data is collected from multiple sources throughout the study:\n\nRegistration: During study enrollment, participants report their regular medications online by selecting from a predefined drop-down list with autofill functionality. Medications that meet exclusion criteria trigger automatic questionnaire termination with an appropriate message.\nMobile application logging: Participants can log medications and consumption times using a dedicated mobile application. Participants are requested to log medications during the two-week periods following each visit.\nFollow-up visits and calls: During follow-up interactions at the clinical testing center or via telephone, participants report any new medications started or stopped, including the month and year of each change. Study staff members record this information using a predefined drop-down list. If a specific medication cannot be found in the list, staff can either log it through the mobile application or use a free-text entry option.\n\n\n\nData availability\n\nMedication data is collected from three sources: - Registration medications: Reported during study sign-up via online questionnaire with autofill functionality - Follow-up medications: Updates provided during follow-up calls or visits to the clinical testing center - Application logging: Real-time medication logging through the mobile application\nAll medication data from these sources is stored in 1 parquet file: medications.parquet\n\n\nSummary of available data\n\nThe medications dataset includes comprehensive information about participants’ medication usage from multiple sources:\n\nMedications at baseline: Medications that participants were taking at the time of enrollment or baseline visit\nMedication changes during follow-up: New medications started or stopped during longitudinal follow-up\nApp-logged medications: Real-time medication logging through the mobile application during the two-week periods following visits\nATC coding: Many medications are coded using the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system for standardized analysis\n\nThe data includes medication names, start and stop dates (month and year), and the source of information (registration, follow-up visit/call, or app logging).

In this study, we leveraged the Human Phenotype Project (HPP) 10K cohort, a large, deeply phenotyped population study cohort with extensive metagenomic profiling, to explore associations between the gut microbiome and 37 health indications. These include conditions with established or emerging links to the microbiome, such as obesity, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, metabolic syndrome, inflammation, liver disease, cardiovascular and kidney conditions, immune and allergic diseases, gastrointestinal symptoms, mental health, and sleep-related traits. Using a curated set of approximately 200 refined phenotypic features and analyzing 1,184 microbial species, we performed robust statistical association analyses. We observed significant enrichment of associations in 14 health indications, with most associations reflecting increased microbial abundance in favorable health states, thereby suggesting potential microbial targets for intervention. This work introduces a publicly available, high-resolution resource to facilitate future research and support the development of microbiome-informed health strategies.\nThe inverted Manhattan plot below displays the log-transformed p-values for associations between microbiome features and multiple health indications. Each point represents a microbial species, with colors indicating different health indication categories.\n\n\n\nimage"

    "text": "Paper summary\n Objective To explore the interplay between dietary modifications, microbiome composition and host metabolic responses in a dietary intervention setting of a personalised postprandial-targeting (PPT) diet versus a Mediterranean (MED) diet in pre-diabetes.   Design In a 6-month dietary intervention, adults with pre-diabetes were randomly assigned to follow an MED or PPT diet (based on a machine-learning algorithm for predicting postprandial glucose responses). Data collected at baseline and 6 months from 200 participants who completed the intervention included: dietary data from self-recorded logging using a smartphone application, gut microbiome data from shotgun metagenomics sequencing of faecal samples, and clinical data from continuous glucose monitoring, blood biomarkers and anthropometrics.   Results  PPT diet induced more prominent changes to the gut microbiome composition, compared with MED diet, consistent with overall greater dietary modifications observed. Particularly, microbiome alpha-diversity increased significantly in PPT (p=0.007) but not in MED arm (p=0.18). Post hoc analysis of changes in multiple dietary features, including food-categories, nutrients and PPT-adherence score across the cohort, demonstrated significant associations between specific dietary changes and species-level changes in microbiome composition. Furthermore, using causal mediation analysis we detect nine microbial species that partially mediate the association between specific dietary changes and clinical outcomes, including three species (from Bacteroidales , Lachnospiraceae , Oscillospirales orders) that mediate the association between PPT-adherence score and clinical outcomes of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglycerides. Finally, using machine-learning models trained on dietary changes and baseline clinical data, we predict personalised metabolic responses to dietary modifications and assess features importance for clinical improvement in cardiometabolic markers of blood lipids, glycaemic control and body weight.    Conclusions Our findings support the role of gut microbiome in modulating the effects of dietary modifications on cardiometabolic outcomes, and advance the concept of precision nutrition strategies for reducing comorbidities in pre-diabetes.

    "text": "Paper summary\nAbstract Background Dietary modifications are crucial for managing newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and preventing its health complications, but many patients fail to achieve clinical goals with diet alone. We sought to evaluate the clinical effects of a personalized postprandial-targeting (PPT) diet on glycemic control and metabolic health in individuals with newly diagnosed T2DM as compared to the commonly recommended Mediterranean-style (MED) diet.  Methods We enrolled 23 adults with newly diagnosed T2DM (aged 53.5 ± 8.9 years, 48% males) for a randomized crossover trial of two 2-week-long dietary interventions. Participants were blinded to their assignment to one of the two sequence groups: either PPT-MED or MED-PPT diets. The PPT diet relies on a machine learning algorithm that integrates clinical and microbiome features to predict personal postprandial glucose responses (PPGR). We further evaluated the long-term effects of PPT diet on glycemic control and metabolic health by an additional 6-month PPT intervention (n = 16). Participants were connected to continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) throughout the study and self-recorded dietary intake using a smartphone application.  Results In the crossover intervention, the PPT diet lead to significant lower levels of CGM-based measures as compared to the MED diet, including average PPGR (mean difference between diets, − 19.8 ± 16.3 mg/dl × h, p &lt; 0.001), mean glucose (mean difference between diets, − 7.8 ± 5.5 mg/dl, p &lt; 0.001), and daily time of glucose levels &gt; 140 mg/dl (mean difference between diets, − 2.42 ± 1.7 h/day, p &lt; 0.001). Blood fructosamine also decreased significantly more during PPT compared to MED intervention (mean change difference between diets, − 16.4 ± 37 μmol/dl, p &lt; 0.0001). At the end of 6 months, the PPT intervention leads to significant improvements in multiple metabolic health parameters, among them HbA1c (mean ± SD, − 0.39 ± 0.48%, p &lt; 0.001), fasting glucose (− 16.4 ± 24.2 mg/dl, p = 0.02) and triglycerides (− 49 ± 46 mg/dl, p &lt; 0.001). Importantly, 61% of the participants exhibited diabetes remission, as measured by HbA1c &lt; 6.5%. Finally, some clinical improvements were significantly associated with gut microbiome changes per person.  Conclusion In this crossover trial in subjects with newly diagnosed T2DM, a PPT diet improved CGM-based glycemic measures significantly more than a Mediterranean-style MED diet. Additional 6-month PPT intervention further improved glycemic control and metabolic health parameters, supporting the clinical efficacy of this approach.

    "text": "Paper summary\n Background: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) accounts for ~90% of all cases of diabetes, resulting in an estimated 6.7 million deaths in 2021, according to the International Diabetes Federation. Early detection of patients with high risk of developing T2D can reduce the incidence of the disease through a change in lifestyle, diet, or medication. Since populations of lower socio-demographic status are more susceptible to T2D and might have limited resources or access to sophisticated computational resources, there is a need for accurate yet accessible prediction models.   Methods: In this study, we analyzed data from 44,709 nondiabetic UK Biobank participants aged 40–69, predicting the risk of T2D onset within a selected time frame (mean of 7.3 years with an SD of 2.3 years). We started with 798 features that we identified as potential predictors for T2D onset. We first analyzed the data using gradient boosting decision trees, survival analysis, and logistic regression methods. We devised one nonlaboratory model accessible to the general population and one more precise yet simple model that utilizes laboratory tests. We simplified both models to an accessible scorecard form, tested the models on normoglycemic and prediabetes subcohorts, and compared the results to the results of the general cohort. We established the nonlaboratory model using the following covariates: sex, age, weight, height, waist size, hip circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, and body mass index. For the laboratory model, we used age and sex together with four common blood tests: high-density lipoprotein (HDL), gamma-glutamyl transferase, glycated hemoglobin, and triglycerides. As an external validation dataset, we used the electronic medical record database of Clalit Health Services.   Results: The nonlaboratory scorecard model achieved an area under the receiver operating curve (auROC) of 0.81 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.77–0.84) and an odds ratio (OR) between the upper and fifth prevalence deciles of 17.2 (95% CI 5–66). Using this model, we classified three risk groups, a group with 1% (0.8–1%), 5% (3–6%), and the third group with a 9% (7–12%) risk of developing T2D. We further analyzed the contribution of the laboratory-based model and devised a blood test model based on age, sex, and the four common blood tests noted above. In this scorecard model, we included age, sex, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c%), gamma glutamyl-transferase, triglycerides, and HDL cholesterol. Using this model, we achieved an auROC of 0.87 (95% CI 0.85–0.90) and a deciles’ OR of ×48 (95% CI 12–109). Using this model, we classified the cohort into four risk groups with the following risks: 0.5% (0.4–7%); 3% (2–4%); 10% (8–12%); and a high-risk group of 23% (10–37%) of developing T2D. When applying the blood tests model using the external validation cohort (Clalit), we achieved an auROC of 0.75 (95% CI 0.74–0.75). We analyzed several additional comprehensive models, which included genotyping data and other environmental factors. We found that these models did not provide cost-efficient benefits over the four blood test model. The commonly used German Diabetes Risk Score (GDRS) and Finnish Diabetes Risk Score (FINDRISC) models, trained using our data, achieved an auROC of 0.73 (0.69–0.76) and 0.66 (0.62–0.70), respectively, inferior to the results achieved by the four blood test model and by the anthropometry models.   Conclusions: The four blood test and anthropometric models outperformed the commonly used nonlaboratory models, the FINDRISC and the GDRS. We suggest that our models be used as tools for decision-makers to assess populations at elevated T2D risk and thus improve medical strategies. These models might also provide a personal catalyst for changing lifestyle, diet, or medication modifications to lower the risk of T2D onset.

    "section": "Paper summary",
    "text": "Paper summary\nAccurate analysis of dietary intake depends on linking food logs to food composition databases (FCDBs), yet these databases are often incomplete, inconsistent across regions, and difficult to harmonize at scale. In this study, the authors introduce NutriMatch, a scalable framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) and semantic embeddings to harmonize food composition databases across languages and regions and to impute missing nutrient values in a transparent and reproducible manner. NutriMatch aligns nutritionally equivalent food items across multiple FCDBs using embedding-based similarity, validates matches with an LLM acting as an automated judge, and enriches nutrient profiles by transferring missing values from matched reference foods s44482-025-00001-7.\nThe method was applied to the Israeli Human Phenotype Project (HPP), a deeply phenotyped cohort of over 10,000 adults who continuously log dietary intake via a mobile application linked to a local FCDB. Using NutriMatch, the authors expanded the HPP database from 21 recorded nutrients to 151 nutrients by harmonizing information from multiple international FCDBs, substantially increasing nutritional resolution while preserving cross-database consistency. Validation analyses demonstrated that two weeks of diet logging provide a stable and reproducible snapshot of long-term nutrient intake, supporting the use of short-term digital food logs for longitudinal phenotype prediction.\nTo assess the impact of nutrient enrichment, the authors evaluated predictive models linking dietary intake to a range of phenotypes, including body composition, blood biomarkers, continuous glucose monitoring metrics, and obesity status at two-year follow-up. Models incorporating the NutriMatch-expanded nutrient set consistently outperformed models based on age alone or basic macronutrients, with particularly strong gains for body fat measures, waist circumference, serum folate, and obesity prediction. Enriched nutrient profiles also revealed biologically coherent associations with metabolomic blood markers, highlighting the added explanatory value of micronutrients beyond standard dietary features.\nGeneralizability was demonstrated by applying the full NutriMatch pipeline to the Australian PREDICT cohort, a randomized clinical trial of individuals with prediabetes or early-stage type 2 diabetes. Nutrient imputations showed high concordance with the Australian reference database, and predictive models trained in HPP transferred to PREDICT without retraining, achieving improved performance compared with baseline nutrient models. Together, these results establish NutriMatch as a robust approach for harmonizing food composition databases, enriching dietary data at scale, and enabling cross-cohort nutritional analyses that improve diet–health modeling across populations and clinical contexts.\n\n\n\n\nimage"

Here, we collected diverse phenotypes and gut microbiota from 34,057 individuals from Israel and the U.S.. Analyzing these data using a much-expanded microbial genomes set, we derive an atlas of robust and numerous unreported associations between bacteria and physiological human traits, which we show to replicate in cohorts from both continents. Using machine learning models trained on microbiome data, we show prediction accuracy of human traits across two continents. Subsampling our cohort to smaller cohort sizes yielded highly variable models and thus sensitivity to the selected cohort, underscoring the utility of large cohorts and possibly explaining the source of discrepancies across studies. Finally, many of our prediction models saturate at these numbers of individuals, suggesting that similar analyses on larger cohorts may not further improve these predictions."

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We randomly assigned adults with prediabetes (n = 225) to follow a MED diet or a PPT diet for a 6-month dietary intervention and additional 6-month follow-up. The PPT diet relies on a machine learning algorithm that integrates clinical and microbiome features to predict personal postprandial glucose responses. During the intervention, all participants were connected to continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and self-reported dietary intake using a smartphone application.   RESULTS Among 225 participants randomized (58.7% women, mean ± SD age 50 ± 7 years, BMI 31.3 ± 5.8 kg/m2, HbA1c, 5.9 ± 0.2% [41 ± 2.4 mmol/mol], fasting plasma glucose 114 ± 12 mg/dL [6.33 ± 0.67 mmol/L]), 200 (89%) completed the 6-month intervention. A total of 177 participants also contributed 12-month follow-up data. Both interventions reduced the daily time with glucose levels &gt;140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) and HbA1c levels, but reductions were significantly greater in PPT compared with MED. The mean 6-month change in “time above 140” was −0.3 ± 0.8 h/day and −1.3 ± 1.5 h/day for MED and PPT, respectively (95% CI between-group difference −1.29 to −0.66, P &lt; 0.001). The mean 6-month change in HbA1c was −0.08 ± 0.19% (−0.9 ± 2.1 mmol/mol) and −0.16 ± 0.24% (−1.7 ± 2.6 mmol/mol) for MED and PPT, respectively (95% CI between-group difference −0.14 to −0.02, P = 0.007). The significant between-group differences were maintained at 12-month follow-up. No significant differences were noted between the groups in a CGM-measured oral glucose tolerance test.   CONCLUSIONS In this clinical trial in prediabetes, a PPT diet improved glycemic control significantly more than a MED diet as measured by daily time of glucose levels &gt;140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) and HbA1c. These findings may have implications for dietary advice in clinical practice."

    "text": "Paper Summary\nThe paper demonstrates how multi-night, high-resolution sleep monitoring data from 6,366 individuals over 16,812 nights from the Human Phenotype Project (HPP) can predict health outcomes across multiple body systems. The study showcases the potential of wearable devices as tools for broad health insights. The study highlights HPP’s unique combination of multi-modal phenotypic data to advance disease risk prediction and personalized health solutions.\nKey findings demonstrate that sleep features are powerful predictors of metabolic, cardiovascular, and mental health outcomes, outperforming traditional metrics in some cases. The predictive models developed in this study offer new opportunities for clinical trial optimization, remote monitoring solutions, and personalized health insights.\nKey findings and numbers:\n\nMulti-modal disease prediction: Sleep traits predicted over 15% of body system traits across 15 of 16 systems, including cardiovascular, metabolic, and even mental health, highlighting the cross-system predictive power of HPP data.\nMetabolic and cardiovascular risk: The study shows that sleep test measures predict insulin resistance traits and blood lipid levels with greater accuracy than traditional metrics. For example, visceral fat (VAT), a key metabolic risk factor, was strongly correlated with the peripheral Apnea-Hypopnea Index (pAHI) (Spearman ρ = 0.52).\nLongitudinal consistency: The model tracked sleep features over time in individuals, showing high consistency in key markers like oxygen saturation and snoring levels, making it a potential tool for long-term health monitoring.\nMental health and lifestyle prediction: Sleep features predicted anxiety (AUC = 0.507 in males, 0.518 in females) and hyperlipidemia (AUC = 0.544 in males, 0.522 in females), beyond traditional metrics. Additionally, lifestyle factors explained over 50% of sleep test variability, highlighting the role of behavior in health outcomes.\nMedical diagnosis associations: The study identified sex-specific associations with various conditions, such as osteopenia, prediabetes, and hypertension in females, and allergy and back pain in males.\nThe study shows the effects of menopause on sleep apnea related metrics, showing that menopause is a strong contributor to sleep apnea independent of age and suggests some of the female sex-specific associations relate to menopausal status.\n\nThese results demonstrate the potential of sleep monitoring as a comprehensive health assessment tool. Sleep features could be used to identify at-risk individuals earlier, forecast clinical trial outcomes, and enable personalized interventions in chronic conditions like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and sleep apnea.\nThis work paves the way for developing AI-based models using multi-night sleep data to improve health forecasting and preventative care across various medical domains. The HPP dataset provides unique value for commercial partners looking to integrate multi-modal health data and wearable devices into clinical research and digital health solutions.\n\n\n\nimage"

    "text": "Paper summary\nABSTRACT Substantial advances in multi-modal Artificial Intelligence (AI) facilitate the combination of diverse medical modalities to achieve holistic health assessments. We present COMPRER, a novel multi-modal, multi-objective pretraining framework which enhances medical-image representation, diagnostic inferences, and prognosis of diseases. COMPRER employs a multi-objective training framework, where each objective introduces distinct knowledge to the model. This includes a multi-modal loss that consolidates information across different imaging modalities; A temporal loss that imparts the ability to discern patterns over time; Medical-measure prediction adds appropriate medical insights; Lastly, reconstruction loss ensures the integrity of image structure within the latent space. Despite the concern that multiple objectives could weaken task performance, our findings show that this combination actually boosts outcomes on certain tasks. Here, we apply this framework to both fundus images and carotid ultrasound, and validate our downstream tasks capabilities by predicting both current and future cardiovascular conditions. COMPRER achieved higher Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores in evaluating medical conditions compared to existing models on held-out data. On the Out-of-distribution (OOD) UK-Biobank dataset COMPRER maintains favorable performance over well-established models with more parameters, even though these models were trained on 75× more data than COMPRER. In addition, to better assess our model’s performance in contrastive learning, we introduce a novel evaluation metric, providing deeper understanding of the effectiveness of the latent space pairing."

    "text": "Paper summary\n OBJECTIVE Previous studies have demonstrated an association between gut microbiota composition and type 1 diabetes (T1D) pathogenesis. However, little is known about the composition and function of the gut microbiome in adults with longstanding T1D or its association with host glycemic control.   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We performed a metagenomic analysis of the gut microbiome obtained from fecal samples of 74 adults with T1D, 14.6 ± 9.6 years following diagnosis, and compared their microbial composition and function to 296 age-matched healthy control subjects (1:4 ratio). We further analyzed the association between microbial taxa and indices of glycemic control derived from continuous glucose monitoring measurements and blood tests and constructed a prediction model that solely takes microbiome features as input to evaluate the discriminative power of microbial composition for distinguishing individuals with T1D from control subjects.   RESULTS Adults with T1D had a distinct microbial signature that separated them from control subjects when using prediction algorithms on held-out subjects (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.89 ± 0.03). Linear discriminant analysis showed several bacterial species with significantly higher scores in T1D, including Prevotella copri and Eubacterium siraeum, and species with higher scores in control subjects, including Firmicutes bacterium and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (P &lt; 0.05, false discovery rate corrected for all). On the functional level, several metabolic pathways were significantly lower in adults with T1D. Several bacterial taxa and metabolic pathways were associated with the host’s glycemic control.   CONCLUSIONS We identified a distinct gut microbial signature in adults with longstanding T1D and associations between microbial taxa, metabolic pathways, and glycemic control indices. Additional mechanistic studies are needed to identify the role of these bacteria for potential therapeutic strategies."

    "text": "Paper summary\nThe genetic diversity of the gut microbiota has a central role in host health. Here, we created pangenomes for 728 human gut prokaryotic species, quadrupling the genes of strain-specific genomes. Each of these species has a core set of a thousand genes, differing even between closely related species, and an accessory set of genes unique to the different strains. Functional analysis shows high strain variability associates with sporulation, whereas low variability is linked with antibiotic resistance. We further map the antibiotic resistome across the human gut population and find 237 cases of extreme resistance even to last-resort antibiotics, with a predominance among Enterobacteriaceae. Lastly, the presence of specific genes in the microbiota relates to host age and sex. Our study underscores the genetic complexity of the human gut microbiota, emphasizing its significant implications for host health. The pangenomes and antibiotic resistance map constitute a valuable resource for further research.\n\n\n\nimage"

In men, weight loss was associated with increased intake of animal-based proteins, whereas in women, it correlated with a higher consumption of plant-based fats. These findings suggest that personalized dietary interventions considering gender-specific needs could enhance obesity management effectiveness.

    "text": "Paper summary\nPlasma fasting glucose (FG) levels play a pivotal role in the diagnosis of prediabetes and diabetes worldwide. Here we investigated FG values using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices in nondiabetic adults aged 40–70 years. FG was measured during 59,565 morning windows of 8,315 individuals (7.16 ± 3.17 days per participant). Mean FG was 96.2 ± 12.87 mg dl−1, rising by 0.234 mg dl−1 per year with age. Intraperson, day-to-day variability expressed as FG standard deviation was 7.52 ± 4.31 mg dl−1. As there are currently no CGM-based criteria for diabetes diagnosis, we analyzed the potential implications of this variability on the classification of glycemic status based on current plasma FG-based diagnostic guidelines. Among 5,328 individuals who would have been considered to have normal FG based on the first FG measurement, 40% and 3% would have been reclassified as having glucose in the prediabetes and diabetes ranges, respectively, based on sequential measurements throughout the study. Finally, we revealed associations between mean FG and various clinical measures. Our findings suggest that careful consideration is necessary when interpreting FG as substantial intraperson variability exists and highlight the potential impact of using CGM data to refine glycemic status assessment."

Technological advances in continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices introduce a potential tool to expand our understanding of glucose control and variability in people with and without diabetes. Yet CGM data have not been characterized in large-scale healthy cohorts, creating a lack of reference for CGM data research. Here we present CGMap, a characterization of CGM data collected from over 7,000 non-diabetic individuals, aged 40–70 years, between 2019 and 2022. We provide reference values of key CGM-derived clinical measures that can serve as a tool for future CGM research. We further explored the relationship between CGM-derived measures and diabetes-related clinical parameters, uncovering several significant relationships, including associations of mean blood glucose with measures from fundus imaging and sleep monitoring. These findings offer novel research directions for understanding the influence of glucose levels on various aspects of human health.\n\n\n\nimage"

The findings revealed notable differences in aging dynamics between males and females, with distinct BA scores correlating with age-related health conditions. Notably, BA scores provided insights into sex-specific risks, such as a higher incidence of osteoporosis in aging women, emphasizing the potential role of menopause in accelerating certain aging processes.\nThe study also highlighted that biological systems age differently between men and women, as evidenced by the variability of biological aging models based on bone density, blood lipids, and cardiovascular function. These models demonstrated better performance among women, potentially reflecting the effects of menopause. The research underscores the significance of considering sex as a biological variable in aging studies and its impact on clinical outcomes. These findings offer a holistic view of aging, which can drive personalized medical prevention strategies and the development of sex-specific interventions to mitigate the impact of aging-related diseases, ultimately contributing to healthier aging.\n\n\n\nimage"

    "text": "Paper summary\nIntroductionMetformin and diets aimed at promoting healthy body weight are the first line in treating type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Clinical practice, backed by clinical trials, suggests that many individuals do not reach glycaemic targets using this approach alone. The primary aim of the Personalised Medicine in Pre-diabetes—Towards Preventing Diabetes in Individuals at Risk (PREDICT) Study is to test the efficacy of personalised diet as adjuvant to metformin in improving glycaemic control in individuals with dysglycaemia.Methods and analysisPREDICT is a two-arm, parallel group, single-masked randomised controlled trial in adults with pre-diabetes or early-stage T2DM (with glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) up to 8.0% (64 mmol/mol)), not treated with glucose-lowering medication. PREDICT is conducted at the Clinical Research Facility at the Garvan Institute of Medical Research (Sydney). Enrolment of participants commenced in December 2018 and expected to complete in December 2021. Participants are commenced on metformin (Extended Release, titrated to a target dose of 1500 mg/day) and randomised with equal allocation to either (1) the Personalised Nutrition Project algorithm-based diet or (2) low-fat high-dietary fibre diet, designed to provide caloric restriction (75%) in individuals with body mass index &gt;25 kg/m2. Treatment duration is 6 months and participants visit the Clinical Research Facility five times over approximately 7 months. The primary outcome measure is HbA1c. The secondary outcomes are (1) time of interstitial glucose &lt;7.8 mmol/L and (2) glycaemic variability (continuous glucose monitoring), (3) body weight, (4) fat mass and (5) abdominal visceral fat volume (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry), serum (6) low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (7) high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and (8) triglycerides concentrations, (9) blood pressure, and (10) liver fat (Fibroscan).Ethics and disseminationThe study has been approved by the St Vincent’s Hospital Human Research Ethics Committee (File 17/080, Sydney, Australia) and the Weizmann Institutional Review Board (File 528-3, Rehovot, Israel). The findings will be published in peer-reviewed open access medical journals.Trial registration numberNCT03558867."

    "text": "Paper summary\nGenome-wide association studies (GWASs) have provided numerous associations between human single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and health traits. Likewise, metagenome-wide association studies (MWASs) between bacterial SNPs and human traits can suggest mechanistic links, but very few such studies have been done thus far. In this study, we devised an MWAS framework to detect SNPs and associate them with host phenotypes systematically. We recruited and obtained gut metagenomic samples from a cohort of 7,190 healthy individuals and discovered 1,358 statistically significant associations between a bacterial SNP and host body mass index (BMI), from which we distilled 40 independent associations. Most of these associations were unexplained by diet, medications or physical exercise, and 17 replicated in a geographically independent cohort. We uncovered BMI-associated SNPs in 27 bacterial species, and 12 of them showed no association by standard relative abundance analysis. We revealed a BMI association of an SNP in a potentially inflammatory pathway of Bilophila wadsworthia as well as of a group of SNPs in a region coding for energy metabolism functions in a Faecalibacterium prausnitzii genome. Our results demonstrate the importance of considering nucleotide-level diversity in microbiome studies and pave the way toward improved understanding of interpersonal microbiome differences and their potential health implications.\n\n\n\nimage"

To date, approximately 28,000 participants have enrolled, with more than 13,000 completing their initial visit. The project is aimed at identifying novel molecular signatures with diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic value, and at developing artificial intelligence (AI)-based predictive models for disease onset and progression. The HPP includes longitudinal profiling encompassing medical history, lifestyle and nutrition, anthropometrics, blood tests, continuous glucose and sleep monitoring, imaging and multi-omics data, including genetics, transcriptomics, microbiome (gut, vaginal and oral), metabolomics and immune profiling. Analysis of these data highlights the variation of phenotypes with age and ethnicity and unravels molecular signatures of disease by comparison with matched healthy controls. Leveraging extensive dietary and lifestyle data, we identify associations between lifestyle factors and health outcomes. Finally, we present a multi-modal foundation AI model, trained using self-supervised learning on diet and continuous-glucose-monitoring data, that outperforms existing methods in predicting disease onset. This framework can be extended to integrate other modalities and act as a personalized digital twin. In summary, we present a deeply phenotyped cohort that serves as a platform for advancing biomarker discovery, enabling the development of multi-modal AI models and personalized medicine approaches.\n\n\n\nimage"

We aim to assess whether a personalised postprandial glucose targeting diet will be beneficial for weight management as compared with the recommended Mediterranean diet in this patient population   Methods and analysis The BREAst Cancer Personalised NuTrition study is a phase-2 randomised trial in hormone receptor positive patients with breast cancer, treated with adjuvant endocrine therapy. The study objective is to assess whether dietary intervention intended to improve postprandial glycaemic response to meals results in better weight and glycaemic control in this population as compared with the standard recommended Mediterranean diet. Consenting participants will be assigned in a single blinded fashion to either of two dietary arms (Mediterranean diet or an algorithm-based personalised diet). They will be asked to provide a stool sample for microbiome analysis and will undergo continuous glucose monitoring for 2 weeks, at the initiation and termination of the intervention period. Microbiome composition data will be used to tailor personal dietary recommendations. After randomisation and provision of dietary recommendations, participants will be asked to continuously log their diet and lifestyle activities on a designated smartphone application during the 6-month intervention period, during which they will be monthly monitored by a certified dietitian. Participants’ clinical records will be followed twice yearly for 5 years for treatment adherence, disease-free survival and recurrence.

    "text": "Paper summary\nAbstractThe gut is the richest ecosystem of microbes in the human body and has great influence on our health. Despite many efforts, the set of microbes inhabiting this environment is not fully known, limiting our ability to identify microbial content and to research it. In this work, we combine new microbial metagenomic assembled genomes from 51,052 samples, with previously published genomes to produce a curated set of 241,118 genomes. Based on this set, we procure a new and improved human gut microbiome reference set of 3594 high quality species genomes, which successfully matches 83.65% validation samples’ reads. This improved reference set contains 310 novel species, including one that exists in 19% of validation samples. Overall, this study provides a gut microbial genome reference set that can serve as a valuable resource for further research."

    "text": "Paper summary\nDiabetes and associated comorbidities are a global health threat on the rise. We conducted a six-month dietary intervention in pre-diabetic individuals (NCT03222791), to mitigate the hyperglycemia and enhance metabolic health. The current work explores early diabetes markers in the 200 individuals who completed the trial. We find 166 of 2,803 measured features, including oral and gut microbial species and pathways, serum metabolites and cytokines, show significant change in response to a personalized postprandial glucose-targeting diet or the standard of care Mediterranean diet. These changes include established markers of hyperglycemia as well as novel features that can now be investigated as potential therapeutic targets. Our results indicate the microbiome mediates the effect of diet on glycemic, metabolic and immune measurements, with gut microbiome compositional change explaining 12.25% of serum metabolites variance. Although the gut microbiome displays greater compositional changes compared to the oral microbiome, the oral microbiome demonstrates more changes at the genetic level, with trends dependent on environmental richness and species prevalence in the population. In conclusion, our study shows dietary interventions can affect the microbiome, cardiometabolic profile and immune response of the host, and that these factors are well associated with each other, and can be harnessed for new therapeutic modalities.\n\n\n\nimage"

    "section": "Paper summary",
    "text": "Paper summary\nContinuous glucose monitoring (CGM) provides high-resolution measurements of glucose dynamics, yet clinical assessment of glycaemic status still relies heavily on laboratory biomarkers such as HbA1c and on a limited set of handcrafted CGM-derived summary metrics. In this study, we introduce GluFormer, a transformer-based foundation model trained using self-supervised learning on more than 10 million CGM measurements from 10,812 adults in the Human Phenotype Project (HPP), the majority of whom did not have diabetes. By learning to autoregressively predict future glucose values from discretized CGM time series, the model captures latent representations of glycaemic physiology directly from raw CGM data.\nWe evaluated GluFormer across 19 external cohorts spanning five countries, eight CGM devices, and a wide range of metabolic and clinical contexts, including prediabetes, type 1 and type 2 diabetes, gestational diabetes, obesity, and multiple clinical trial populations. Across these settings, GluFormer-derived representations consistently improved prediction of contemporaneous and future glycaemic measures compared with standard CGM-derived metrics such as GMI, time-in-range, and glycaemic variability. In individuals with prediabetes, the model stratified two-year HbA1c trajectories more effectively than baseline HbA1c, identifying individuals at risk of glycaemic deterioration despite similar initial laboratory measurements.\nIn an independent population-based cohort with a median follow-up of 11 years, GluFormer embeddings were strongly associated with long-term clinical outcomes. The majority of incident diabetes cases and cardiovascular deaths occurred among individuals in the highest risk quartile defined by the model, whereas baseline HbA1c did not meaningfully stratify risk. These findings indicate that dynamic CGM patterns encode prognostic information that is not captured by static glycaemic biomarkers.\nBeyond outcome prediction, GluFormer accurately generated physiologically realistic CGM trajectories, reproducing key clinical glucose metrics across diverse populations, disease states, and devices. A multimodal extension of the model that integrates dietary information further improved prediction of postprandial glucose responses, demonstrating the potential of combining behavioral and physiological data within a unified foundation modeling framework. Together, this work establishes CGM-based foundation models as a scalable approach for extracting clinically relevant representations of metabolic health, with potential applications in early risk stratification, long-term outcome prediction, and precision medicine.\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\n\n\nimage"

    "section": "Paper summary",
    "text": "Paper summary\n OBJECTIVE Despite technological advances, results from various clinical trials have repeatedly shown that many individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) do not achieve their glycemic goals. One of the major challenges in disease management is the administration of an accurate amount of insulin for each meal that will match the expected postprandial glycemic response (PPGR). The objective of this study was to develop a prediction model for PPGR in individuals with T1D.   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We recruited individuals with T1D who were using continuous glucose monitoring and continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion devices simultaneously to a prospective cohort and profiled them for 2 weeks. Participants were asked to report real-time dietary intake using a designated mobile app. We measured their PPGRs and devised machine learning algorithms for PPGR prediction, which integrate glucose measurements, insulin dosages, dietary habits, blood parameters, anthropometrics, exercise, and gut microbiota. Data of the PPGR of 900 healthy individuals to 41,371 meals were also integrated into the model. The performance of the models was evaluated with 10-fold cross validation.   RESULTS A total of 121 individuals with T1D, 75 adults and 46 children, were included in the study. PPGR to 6,377 meals was measured. Our PPGR prediction model substantially outperforms a baseline model with emulation of standard of care (correlation of R = 0.59 compared with R = 0.40 for predicted and observed PPGR respectively; P &lt; 10−10). The model was robust across different subpopulations. Feature attribution analysis revealed that glucose levels at meal initiation, glucose trend 30 min prior to meal, meal carbohydrate content, and meal’s carbohydrate-to-fat ratio were the most influential features for the model.   CONCLUSIONS Our model enables a more accurate prediction of PPGR and therefore may allow a better adjustment of the required insulin dosage for meals. It can be further implemented in closed loop systems and may lead to rationally designed nutritional interventions personally tailored for individuals with T1D on the basis of meals with expected low glycemic response."

    "text": "Description\nThe dataset, derived from Nightingale Health’s metabolic profiling of blood serum samples, presents an extensive array of metabolites, encapsulating lipids, fatty acids, amino acids, and various low-molecular-weight metabolites. Utilizing innovative Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) technology, the dataset unveils a spectrum of 250 biomarkers, 39 of which are clinically validated, offering a profound insight into the metabolic mechanisms underlying health and disease.\n\n\nIntroduction\nNightingale Health is a global health-tech company that is changing healthcare with its advanced blood testing technology, employing its proprietary Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). The biomarker panel provided by Nightingale encompasses a total of 250 biomarkers, of which 39 have been clinically validated. These biomarkers span across various categories including lipoprotein lipids, fatty acids, and small molecules such as amino acids and ketones, thereby offering a rich tapestry of metabolic insights. The dataset generated from the metabolic profiling of our blood serum samples allows for an in-depth exploration into the metabolic foundations of both health and disease. The data captures a wide spectrum of metabolites including lipids, fatty acids, amino acids, and other low-molecular-weight metabolites, all rendered through Nightingale’s advanced NMR technology.\nThis dataset serves as a valuable resource for: 1. Identifying Metabolic Signatures: Unveiling unique metabolic patterns linked with various health conditions. 2. Predictive Modeling: Building predictive models for early disease detection and prognosis. 3. Nutritional Analysis: Evaluating the influence of nutrition on metabolic profiles. 4. Drug Response Analysis: Understanding the metabolic responses to drug treatments.\nFurthermore, the dataset holds promise for multi-omic analyses when combined with genomic, transcriptomic, etc. thus presenting a holistic view of the biological and metabolic landscape. The comprehensive nature of this dataset, coupled with the innovative technology from Nightingale, provides a valuable resource for propelling research and clinical applications aimed at ameliorating health outcomes.\nThe Nightingale NMR platform stands out from other metabolomics techniques such as mass spectrometry, due to its minimal batch effects, low requisites for expensive reagents, and high throughput at a relatively lower cost. NMR spectroscopy, grounded in the interaction of externally applied radiofrequency radiation with atomic nuclei, facilitates the quantification of over 200 biomarkers in absolute units from a single blood sample. The absolute concentrations of metabolite levels provided are calibrated against global standards, making the results easily comparable to other studies and traditional clinical chemistry methods.\n\n\nMeasurement protocol\n\nAfter collecting blood samples from participants during clinic visits, the blood samples are immediately placed in tubes and processed to separate the serum. These serum samples are then stored in plates and kept in the freezer to maintain their integrity until shipment. Upon arrival at Nightingale Health’s laboratories, the serum samples are once again frozen. When ready for analysis, the samples are thawed and undergo a series of preparatory steps. Firstly, the samples are subjected to centrifugation, which helps to remove any remaining cellular debris and ensures a clear serum sample. Following preparation, the samples are analyzed using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. NMR spectroscopy measures the magnetic properties of atomic nuclei to determine the concentrations of various metabolites present in the serum. This technology allows for the simultaneous quantification of multiple metabolites from a single blood sample, including lipids, fatty acids, amino acids, and various low-molecular-weight compounds.\nThe spectrometer machine used for these analyses is the Bruker AVANCE III 500 #60, which is well-regarded for its precision and reliability in metabolic profiling.\n\n\n\nnightingale machine\n\n\nNightingale Health utilizes advanced algorithms to process the spectral data obtained from NMR, identifying and quantifying a wide range of metabolites. To ensure data quality and accuracy, Nightingale Health provides a comprehensive quality control (QC) report for each batch of samples. This report includes categorical QC tags for each metabolite in each sample and binary QC indications per sample, highlighting any potential issues that may need addressing.\nFor more detailed information on Nightingale Health’s technology and measurement protocol, you can visit their website https://nightingalehealth.com/technology and explore their Biomarkers.\n\n\nData availability\n\nThe information is stored in 2 parquet file: 1.

    "text": "Description\nSleep monitoring includes sleep staging, body positioning, respiratory events, heart rate, oxygen saturation and snoring, measured concurrently over three nights.\n\n\nIntroduction\n\nObstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a sleep disorder in which a person’s breathing is interrupted during sleep due to obstruction of the upper airway as a result of relaxation of the throat muscles. This obstruction can lead to pauses in breathing for short periods of time, which can cause loud snoring, reduction in the blood oxygen levels, stress response, awakening and fragmented sleep.\nA home sleep apnea test (HSAT) is a non-invasive test used to diagnose sleep apnea. During an HSAT, a patient wears a portable device overnight to monitor their breathing, heart rate, oxygen levels, snoring, and other sleep patterns. The device records this data and it is then analyzed by clinically-validated algorithms that compute apnea-related indices. The data can also be used to study sleep architecture and other aspects of sleep, such as heart rate variability (HRV) and arrhythmia.\nThe device used for sleep monitoring in the Human Phenotype Project is the FDA-approved WatchPAT-300 by Itamar Medical. This device contains 5 sensors: An actigraph worn on the wrist; a pulse oximeter and a Peripheral Arterial Tone (PAT) probe worn on the finger; and a microphone and accelerometer worn on the chest for respiratory effort, snoring and body position measurement (RESBP).\nThe PAT probe measures changes in the volume of blood vessels by applying a uniform pressure field over the covered finger, preventing venous blood accumulation while measuring changes in the flow within the probe with a photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensor. The measured PAT signal is a physiological signal that reflects changes in the autonomic nervous system caused by respiratory disturbances during sleep. WatchPAT’s algorithm analyzes the PAT signal amplitude, heart rate, and oxygen saturation to identify and classify sleep-related breathing problems.\nThe device’s algorithms provide 3 main indices for diagnosis of OSA: Apnea/Hypopnea Index (AHI), Respiratory Disturbance Index (RDI), Oxygen Desaturation Index (ODI). The device’s algoithms also provide indices for diagnosis of Atrial Fibrillation (not FDA-approved yet): Premature beats per minute, Atrial fibrillation longest event.\nIn addition to the above, the device’s algorithms provide statistics on sleep architecture. Furthermore, we use NeuroKit2 (Makowski et al., 2021) to compute HRV indices from the PAT channel.\n\n\nMeasurement protocol\n\nThe WatchPAT device is given to participants during the visit to the clinical testing center who then record 3 nights of sleep at home during the following two weeks (see figure below). Participants who use CPAP/BiPap devices are asked to report the usage of CPAP/BiPap devices in the HPP App per the monitored nights.\n\n\n\nimage alt\n\n\nFigure 1: WatchPAT-300 device. (Source: Itamar Medical)\nGeneral guidelines: Once the device is turned on it cannot be turned off, and should therefore be turned on only when the participant is ready to go to sleep. The device should not be removed if the participant needs to get up during the night. The device will turn off automatically when the participant wakes up. The PAT probe is replaced each night, and 3 probes are provided to each participant. Finally, the device is returned to the clinic and the data is analyzed.\nPAT setup: It is recommended to apply the WatchPAT device on the non-dominant hand. The PAT probe can be worn on any finger, except the thumb. In the case of large fingers, the pinky is recommended. Before use, it is recommended to remove tight clothes, rings, watches and other jewelry. Artificial nails and nail polish should be removed from the test finger, and the fingernail should be cut short. The finger is inserted into the probe until reaching its end, until the sticker marked TOP is on the top of the finger above the nail. The finger is then pressed against a hard surface. Finally, the top tab is removed.\nRESBP setup: Trim thick chest hair, if needed. Stick the sensor to the center of the upper chest bone, just below the front of the neck. The image on the RESBP sensor should be facing up. Secure the sensor using the provided sticker on its back and additional medical tape.\nWatchPAT device setup: It is strapped on the wrist of the non-dominant hand.\n\n\nData availability\n\nThe information is stored in 2 main statistics parquet files: sleep.parquet, hrv.parquet (computed using NeuroKit2); In multiple events parquets and in multiple time series parquets / EDF files containing sensor channels for each night of logging.\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR;\n\nSensor(sleep sensor):::sensor --&gt; Raw(raw channel):::raw\nRaw --&gt;|zzzPAT| Events(sleep events):::event\nRaw --&gt;|NeuroKit2| Extracted(computed stats)\nEvents --&gt; Extracted\nEvents --&gt;|zzzPAT| Summary(summary stats):::stat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary of available data\n\nThe data comprises of 3 levels of processing:\n\nRaw channels: A data frame of temporal data - values and times - for each of 12 source channels.\nEvents: A data frame of annotated events based on the manufacturer’s analysis of the raw channels. Each row contains the event, its main source channel, its start time and end time.\nSummary statistics: A data frame of computed features provided by the manufacturer based on the above channels and events. Some of the summary stats are also computed separately for different sleep stages and body positions.

    "text": "Description\nThe vaginal microbiome dataset characterizes the bacterial communities present in the vaginal environment via metagenomic sequencing of vaginal swab samples. This dataset enables the exploration of the diverse bacterial populations residing in the vaginal tract, their relative abundances, and potential associations with women’s health conditions. Understanding the vaginal microbiome composition provides insights into conditions such as bacterial vaginosis and other vaginal health-related outcomes.\n\n\nIntroduction\nThe vaginal microbiome represents a dynamic ecosystem that plays a crucial role in maintaining vaginal health. Unlike the gut microbiome, a healthy vaginal microbiome is often characterized by lower diversity and dominance of specific bacterial genera, particularly Lactobacillus species. Alterations in the vaginal bacterial community have been associated with various health conditions, including bacterial vaginosis, which affects 20-60% of women globally.\nThrough shotgun metagenomic sequencing of vaginal swab samples, this dataset provides comprehensive taxonomic profiling of vaginal bacterial communities. The data enables investigation of the relationship between vaginal microbiome composition and various health outcomes, reproductive health, and other phenotypic characteristics collected as part of the Human Phenotype Project.\nNote: The current DNA extraction protocol is optimized for bacterial DNA and does not adequately recover fungal DNA. Therefore, fungal species (such as Candida) are not reliably detected in this dataset.\n\n\nMeasurement protocol\n\nTo characterize the vaginal microbiome, the following steps are performed:\n\nSample collection: A vaginal swab sample is self-collected by each participant during their visit using a standardized swab kit.\nDNA extraction: DNA is extracted from the swab sample using techniques optimized for bacterial DNA isolation.\nDNA sequencing: The extracted DNA is sequenced using high-throughput sequencing technologies.\nQuality control and filtering: Raw sequencing reads are processed using Trimmomatic with a minimum length setting of 50 to remove low-quality reads and sequencing artifacts.\nHuman read removal: Human reads are filtered using Bowtie with the CHM13v2 (T2T) human genome reference to isolate non-human (microbial) sequences.\nTaxonomic classification: Non-human reads are classified using Kraken2 against the Vaginal Microbiome Genome Collection (VMGC) reference database to identify bacterial species and their abundances.\n\nA minimum threshold of 50,000 non-human reads is required for reliable species detection and sample differentiation.\n\n\n\nVaginal Microbiome Kit\n\n\nFigure 1: Vaginal Microbiome Kit Components. The kit includes a sterile swab in a medical grade paper pouch. An empty tube for placing the sampled tip after sampling is also present in cat:50U003DS. However, this tube is not used, as the CTC coordinator provides the participant with a separate safelock barcoded tube prior to VMB sampling. To conduct the self-sample test, the participant is instructed to wash her hands with soap (or put on gloves). She should then place the provided barcoded tube on the designated stand and open the paper pouch. Then, by holding the swab in the middle of the handle, perform the self-sampling test.\n\n\nData availability\n\nA vaginal swab sample is collected from every female HPP participant. To date, 1,622 samples have been sequenced and processed through the vaginal microbiome pipeline. Per-participant output files include:\n\nKraken2 report: A tab-delimited file summarizing taxonomic classification results. Each row represents a taxon and includes the percentage of reads assigned, number of reads assigned directly and to the clade, taxonomic rank (Domain, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species), taxonomic ID, and taxon name.\nKraken2 output: A per-read classification file where each row represents a single sequencing read. Columns indicate classification status (C = classified, U = unclassified), read ID, assigned taxonomic ID, read length, and k-mer mapping information showing how the read was classified across its length.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngraph LR;\n    A(Raw FASTQ File) --&gt; |Trimmomatic| B(Clean FASTQ File)\n    B --&gt; |Bowtie CHM13v2| C(Non Human Reads)\n    B --&gt; |Bowtie CHM13v2| D(Human Reads)\n    C --&gt; |Kraken2 VMGC| E(Kraken2 Report)\n    C --&gt; |Kraken2 VMGC| F(Kraken2 Output)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary of available data\n\n\nDNA Sequencing files\n\nRaw FASTQ file\nTrimmed FASTQ file\nNon-human FASTQ file (filtered)\n\nBacterial\n\nKraken2 report (taxonomic abundance summary)\nKraken2 output (per-read classifications)",

    "text": "Description\nBody composition was profiled based on DXA (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry) imaging, and includes measurements of fat and lean mass for the legs, arms, trunk, gynoid, and android, as well as measurements of total scan visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) area, mass and volume are included.\n\n\nIntroduction\nDXA (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry) is a medical imaging technique that is used to measure body composition, specifically the amounts of bone, fat, and lean muscle tissue in the body. A DXA scan uses a low dose of ionizing radiation to produce a detailed image of the body, which is then analyzed by a software to determine the body composition. This method is considered to be one of the most accurate methods for measuring body composition, as it is able to distinguish between different types of tissue and provide detailed information about the distribution of fat and muscle in the body. DXA imaging is commonly used for assessing bone density and for monitoring changes in body composition over time, such as during weight loss, muscle building programs or for assessment of sarcopenia.\n\n\nMeasurement protocol\n\nDual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) was performed with the GE Lunar Prodigy Advance device (GE Healthcare, USA) and the GE CoreScan software application. Before the scan, participants were asked to remove all metal items, heavy clothing and shoes. Each participant performed a total body scan in a supine position to determine percent body fat, fat mass, lean body mass, and bone mineral density. The total body composition is calculated for various regions (arms, legs, trunk, android, gynoid and total). The CoreScan also estimates the Visceral Adipose Tissue (VAT) and Subcutaneous Adipose Tissue (SAT) content within the android region. Bone mineral density was measured from the Femur necks, bilaterally and from the spine vertebra L1-L4.\n\n\n\nDXA\n\n\n\n\nData availability\n\nThe information is stored in 1 parquet file:

    "text": "Description\nAnthropometrics is the study of the measurement of the human body in terms of the size, weight, and proportions of its various parts.\n\n\nIntroduction\nAnthropometrics is an important tool in the field of medicine, as it allows for the assessment of a person’s health and nutritional status, as well as the identification of potential health risks.\nAnthropometric measurements can be used to assess the body composition of adults, which can help to identify potential health risks such as sarcopenia (age-related loss of muscle mass) or obesity. In a clinical setting, anthropometric measurements are typically used in combination with other medical tests and evaluations to provide a more complete picture of a person’s health. For example, a doctor may use anthropometric measurements in combination with blood tests and imaging studies to assess a person’s nutrition status, or to identify potential health risks such as cardiovascular disease or diabetes. Additionally, these measurements may be used to help monitor the effectiveness of treatment interventions, such as weight loss programs, and to track changes in a person’s health over time.\n\n\nMeasurement protocol\n\nOur anthropometric measurements include height, weight, waist circumference, hip circumference, and neck circumference. The equipment used in this protocol includes a measuring tape and a scale, specifically a Shekel stadiometer (Shekel Ultrasonic Physician BMI Scale h 120-4). The stadiometer used is shown in the figure below.\n\n\n\nimage alt\n\n\nFor measuring height, participants are asked to stand with their face against the scale, legs parallel to each other, toes pointing forward, and soles flat on the floor. Ensure participant’s posture is unsupported, to stand as tall as possible, completely standing on the scale with legs straight. The height is recorded in centimeters.\nFor measuring weight, the participant is asked to remove their shoes and excess clothing, and stand on the stadiometer. The weight is recorded in kilograms. The measurement protocol for the waist, hip, and neck circumference include specific instructions for standing position, and the use of measuring tape. All circumference measurements are recorded in centimeters.\n\n\nData availability\n\nThe information is stored in 1 parquet file: anthropometrics.parquet\n\n\nSummary of available data\n\nA data frame of tabular data containing individual level body measurement records and derived measures, including: - Height (measured in centimeters using stadiometer) - Weight (measured in kilograms) - Waist circumference (measured in centimeters) - Hip circumference (measured in centimeters) - Neck circumference (measured in centimeters) - Derived measures such as Body Mass Index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio\n\n\nRelevant links\n\nPheno Data Browser\n\n\nfrom pheno_utils import PhenoLoader\n\n\npl = PhenoLoader('anthropometrics')\npl\n\nPhenoLoader for anthropometrics with\n12 fields\n2 tables: ['anthropometrics', 'age_sex']\n\n\n\n\nData dictionary\n\npl.dict\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfolder_id\nfeature_set\nfield_string\nrelative_location\ndescription_string\nstability\nfield_type\ndata_coding\nunits\nsampling_rate\nstrata\nsexed\narray\nlist_of_tags\nbulk_dictionary\nbulk_file_extension\ndebut\ncompleted\ntransformation\npandas_dtype\n\n\ntabular_field_name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncollection_date\n2\nanthropometrics\nCollection date (YYYY-MM-DD)\nanthropometrics/anthropometrics.parquet\nCollection date (YYYY-MM-DD)\nAccruing\nDate\nNaN\nTime\nNaN\nPrimary\nBoth sexes\nSingle\nAntrhoprometry; Physical Measures; Body size m...\nNaN\nNaN\n2019-01-29\nNaN\nNaN\ndatetime64[ns]\n\n\ncollection_timestamp\n2\nanthropometrics\nCollection timestamp\nanthropometrics/anthropometrics.parquet\nCollection timestamp\nAccruing\nDatetime\nNaN\nTime\nNaN\nPrimary\nBoth sexes\nSingle\nAntrhoprometry; Physical Measures; Body size m...\nNaN\nNaN\n2019-01-29\nNaN\nNaN\ndatetime64[ns, Asia/Jerusalem]\n\n\nheight\n2\nanthropometrics\nHeight\nanthropometrics/anthropometrics.parquet\nHeight\nAccruing\nInteger\nNaN\ncm\nNaN\nPrimary\nBoth sexes\nSingle\nAntrhoprometry; Physical Measures; Body size m...\nNaN\nNaN\n2019-01-29\nNaN\nNaN\nfloat\n\n\nweight\n2\nanthropometrics\nWeight\nanthropometrics/anthropometrics.parquet\nWeight\nAccruing\nContinuous\nNaN\nkg\nNaN\nPrimary\nBoth sexes\nSingle\nAntrhoprometry; Physical Measures; Body size m...\nNaN\nNaN\n2019-01-29\nNaN\nNaN\nfloat\n\n\nbmi\n2\nanthropometrics\nBody mass index (BMI)\nanthropometrics/anthropometrics.parquet\nBody mass index (BMI), weight in kilograms div...\nAccruing\nContinuous\nNaN\nkg/m2\nNaN\nPrimary\nBoth sexes\nSingle\nAntrhoprometry; Physical Measures; Body size m...\nNaN\nNaN\n2019-01-29\nNaN\nNaN\nfloat\n\n\nwaist_circumference\n2\nanthropometrics\nWaist circumference\nanthropometrics/anthropometrics.parquet\nWaist circumference, measurement taken around ...\nAccruing\nInteger\nNaN\ncm\nNaN\nPrimary\nBoth sexes\nSingle\nAntrhoprometry; Physical Measures; Body size m...\nNaN\nNaN\n2019-01-29\nNaN\nNaN\nfloat\n\n\nneck_circumference\n2\nanthropometrics\nNeck circumference\nanthropometrics/anthropometrics.parquet\nNeck circumference, measured at the mid-point ...\nAccruing\nInteger\nNaN\ncm\nNaN\nPrimary\nBoth sexes\nSingle\nAntrhoprometry; Physical Measures; Body size m...\nNaN\nNaN\n2022-05-19\nNaN\nNaN\nfloat\n\n\nhip_circumference\n2\nanthropometrics\nHip circumference\nanthropometrics/anthropometrics.parquet\nHip circumference measured around the widest p...\nAccruing\nInteger\nNaN\ncm\nNaN\nPrimary\nBoth sexes\nSingle\nAntrhoprometry; Physical Measures; Body size m...\nNaN\nNaN\n2019-01-29\nNaN\nNaN\nfloat\n\n\nwaist_to_hip_ratio\n2\nanthropometrics\nWaist to hip ratio\nanthropometrics/anthropometrics.parquet\nWaist to hip ratio (WHR), a measure or the rat...\nAccruing\nContinuous\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nPrimary\nBoth sexes\nSingle\nAntrhoprometry; Physical Measures; Body size m...\nNaN\nNaN\n2019-01-29\nNaN\nNaN\nfloat\n\n\ntimezone\n2\nanthropometrics\nTimezone\nanthropometrics/anthropometrics.parquet\nTimezone\nAccruing\nText\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nAuxiliary\nBoth sexes\nSingle\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\n2019-01-01\nNaN\nNaN\nstring\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot histogram and ecdf for bmi at baseline visit\n\nfrom pheno_utils.basic_plots import hist_ecdf_plots\n\ncol = \"bmi\"\ndf = pl[[col] + [\"age\", \"sex\", \"collection_date\"]].loc[:,:,\"00_00_visit\",0,:]\n\n# plot histogram and ecdf\nhist_ecdf_plots(df.dropna(subset=[col,\"sex\", \"age\"]), col, gender_col=\"sex\")\n\n# stats\ndisplay(df[col].describe().to_frame().T)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncount\nmean\nstd\nmin\n25%\n50%\n75%\nmax\n\n\n\n\nbmi\n10382.0\n26.152419\n4.177653\n16.121167\n23.198315\n25.614045\n28.528357\n47.238043",

    "text": "Description\nThe HPP Untargeted Metabolomics dataset contains high-throughput serum metabolomic profiles derived from HPP participants. The profiling utilizes liquid chromatography coupled with ion mobility–mass spectrometry (LC-IM-MS) to capture a broad spectrum of circulating small molecules, including diet-derived compounds, microbial metabolites, and host-related molecules.\n\n\nIntroduction\nAs part of the HPP goal to deeply characterize the health-disease continuum, untargeted metabolomics provides a functional readout of the interplay between genetics, environment, and lifestyle. This dataset allows for the reconstruction of complex eating patterns and the identification of diet-disease mechanisms using objective molecular markers rather than self-reported data alone\n\n\nMeasurement protocol\n\nSample preparation\nSerum samples were thawed on ice with a Tecan robotic platform and aliquoted into 96-well plates in batches of 320 (80 samples/rack, 4 racks/batch). These were then stored at –80 °C until analysis and were thawed on ice immediately prior to extraction. Protein precipitation was performed using an automated liquid handling system (epMotion 96xl, Eppendorf), by adding 400 µL of cold methanol to 100 µL of sample. Following mixing and centrifugation, 150 µL of the supernatant was collected and dried under vacuum. Dried serum extracts were reconstituted in 50 µL of methanol prior to UPLC–MS analysis.\n\n\nUPLC Method\nChromatographic separation was performed using an ACQUITY™ Premier UPLC™ system (Waters Corporation) equipped with an ACQUITY Premier BEH C18 column with VanGuard FIT guard (1.7 µm, 2.1 × 100 mm). Reverse-phase separation was carried out using mobile phase A: 0.025% (v/v) acetic acid in 95% water / 5% acetonitrile, and mobile phase B: 0.025% (v/v) acetic acid in 95% acetonitrile / 5% water. The flow rate was set to 0.35 mL/min, and the injection volume was 2 µL using partial-loop mode with needle overfill.\nThe gradient elution program was as follows: 0 min, 100% A; linear decrease to 25% A at 4.0 min; to 0% A at 5.3 min; held at 0% A until 8.3 min; returned to 100% A at 8.5 min and held until 11.0 min for column re-equilibration.\n\n\nIon Mobility–Mass Spectrometry (IM–MS) Analysis\nAll analyses were performed using a Waters SELECT SERIES Cyclic IMS time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometer (Waters Corporation, Wilmslow, UK), equipped with an electrospray ionization (ESI) source and operated in negative ion mode. Data was acquired in high-definition MSE (HDMSE) mode over an m/z range of 50–1200, with a scan time of 0.1 s. Travelling wave ion mobility separation (TWIMS) was performed with a single pass of the cyclic device. Calibration of both the mass spectrometer and the ion mobility device was performed using the Major Mix IMS/TOF calibration solution prior to analysis. Data acquisition was conducted in V-mode using MassLynx software (Waters).\nInstrument parameters were optimized to enhance detection of small and labile compounds. Source conditions were set as follows: capillary voltage, 0.8 kV; cone voltage, 10 V; cone gas flow, 50 L/h; source offset voltage, 10 V; and desolvation temperature, 400°C. The body gradient, post-trap gradient, and transfer gradient voltages were maintained at 5 V, 3 V, and 4 V, respectively. A manual quadrupole (Quad) MS profile was used with set points of 60, 100 and 125 m/z, and dwell and ramp times all set to 25 %. StepWave RF voltage was set at 100 V; ion guide RF voltage, 150 V; and transfer RF voltage, 150 V. The cyclic and array traveling wave velocity was set at 375 m/s. Traveling wave ramp parameters included a start height of 10 V and an end height of 20 V, ramped at a rate of 0.5 V/ms. Inject and separate times were set at 2 and 4 ms, respectively, with TOF data collected at three pushes per bin.\n\n\nProcessing and Annotation\nRaw data were processed using Progenesis QI software (version 3.0, Waters Corporation), including peak detection, alignment, and intra-batch normalization to adjust for technical variability within each analytical batch.\nMetabolites were putatively identified (MSI Level 2) using Progenesis QI. The integrated MetaScope search engine matched features against the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) using stringent criteria: a 5 ppm mass tolerance (with final annotations demonstrating &lt;2 ppm mass accuracy), a 10 ppm product ion mass tolerance for MS/MS fragmentation, and a fragmentation score &gt;60% (except for one Eicosapentaenoic acid metabolite). A minimum 90% isotopic pattern similarity was also mandated. For collision cross section (CCS) matching, all annotations exhibited a maximum 2.5% deviation from predicted HMDB values. Additionally, two metabolites were specifically identified with &lt;2.5% deviation using the Metabolic Profiling CCS Library search plugin.\n\n\n\nData availability\n\n\nTabular data containing feature intensities and annotations (Progenesis QI output)\n\nNote: The dataset comprises approximately 2000 metabolite features, with roughly 10% chemically annotated at high confidence.",

    "text": "Description\nContinuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) measures glucose levels in a continuous manner. This measure provides information on blood glucose control and glucose variability and could be used to monitor patients with diabetes.\n\n\nIntroduction\nIn healthy individuals, insulin secretion from the pancreas is responsible for maintaining normal blood glucose levels. Insulin resistance, the main cause of type-2 diabetes and a key aspect in several other metabolic disorders, occurs when the sensitivity to insulin is impaired leading to reduced insulin mediated glucose disposal. Measuring insulin levels is complex and requires special laboratory tests, while glucose levels are measured by simple blood tests.\nAlthough measuring blood glucose levels using a blood test is simple and inexpensive, a single measure of blood glucose will not contain information on glucose variability, and might not be accurate in certain conditions.\nCGM provides continuous measures of the glucose levels in the interstitial fluid, through a tiny electrochemical sensor electrode inserted under the skin. The continuous measures obtained with CGM present a tool to overcome the limitations of a single measure of blood glucose through blood tests, by providing real time information of glucose levels, rate of change, variability and impending hypo- and hyper- glycemia events.\nCurrently approved CGM devices use an enzymatic technology which reacts with glucose molecules in the interstitial fluid generating an electric current. This current is proportional to glucose concentration in the blood, thus providing information of blood glucose levels in a continuous manner.\nCoupled with nutritional and behavioral information, data collected from the CGM could be used in research to better understand mechanisms of glucose response and control, and how these changes in different individuals, lifestyle choices and phenotypes.\nThe Human Phenotype Project (HPP) collects CGM data on each participant, to produce blood glucose measures every 15 minutes, for a total connection period of two weeks. Summary statistics are calculated for each CGM connection using the iglu package (Broll et al., 2021), providing varying summary measures of glucose control and variability.\n\n\nMeasurement protocol\n\nFreeStyle Libre ProIQ Flash device (see figure below) is used for continuous glucose monitoring for a 2-week period in the baseline visit only. During this time participants are also required to log information about food, medications, physical activity and sleep hours using the HPP application. During the baseline visit the sensor is placed on the participant’s upper arm back.\nThe figure illustrates the connection procedure of the device. Once attached the device is also activated. It is explained to the participant that in case of MRI the sensor should be removed before the scan, and that it is not possible to dive with the device deeper than one meter. The participant is requested to remove the device independently at the end of the 2-week period and send it back to the clinic.\n\n\n\nCGM\n\n\n\n\nData availability\n\nThe metadata and summary features are stored in 3 main statistics parquet files: cgm.parquet, iglu.parquet, iglu_daily.parquet (Computed using the iglu package).\n\n\nSummary of available data\n\n\nTemporal data: A data frame

    "text": "Description\nThe Human Phenotype Project collects genomic variation data on all its participants. The genomic data together with the Human Phenotype Project deep-phenotypes allows to investigate the progression of disease, and to explore personalized treatments. We genotype millions of positions by low-pass sequencing combined with imputation using gencove platform technologies. Genotype imputation is a process of statistically inferring unobserved genotypes using known haplotypes in a population. The performance of Gencove genotype imputation is very high ( accuracy &gt; 98% ) (Wasik et al. 2021).\n\n\nIntroduction\nGenomic variation refers to DNA sequence differences between individuals. Some genetic variants can influence biological function (such as a mutation that causes a genetic disease), while others have no known effects. The genomic data together with the Human Phenotype Project rich variety of phenotypic data enables investigation of how genetics impact the progression of disease, and exploration of personalized prevention strategies and treatments.\nThe Human Phenotype Project uses low-pass sequencing combined with imputation to obtain genomic variation, using genocve platform technologies. We do not target specific regions by sequencing, but rather sample the entire genome with low average depth of coverage, and impute the sequence data to the haplotype reference panel which includes a large set of known genetic variants. Briefly, the model approach is to identify haplotypes shared between a study sample and a reference panel based on the study sample observed genotypes. Next, the unobserved genotypes are extrapolated according to the large reference data as illustrated in Figure 1. Imputation is performed for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and short insertion–deletion variants (indels), structural variation are currently not included. The overall accuracy of gencove imputed genotypes is 98.22% (Wasik et al. 2021). We also validated the accuracy of the imputation using two hundred Human Phenotype Project participants from several ancestries which had both low-pass sequencing done and Illumina genotyping array data. We obtained high concordance rates, greater than 96%.\n\n\n\nstudy sample\n\n\nFigure 1: taken from Li et al. 2013. Panel A illustrates the observed data which consists of genotypes at a modest number of genetic markers in each sample being studied and of detailed information on genotypes (or haplotypes) for a reference sample. Panel B illustrates the process of identifying regions of chromosomes shared between a study sample and individuals in the reference panel. In Panel C, observed genotypes and haplotype sharing information have been combined to fill in a series of unobserved genotypes in the study sample.*\n\n\nMeasurement protocol\n\n\nGenotyping Procedure\nDNA is collected from Human Phenotype Project participants using a buccal swab during their baseline visit. DNA is collected only once as germline DNA is considered constant. The buccal swabs are shipped to Gencove laboratories. The entire sequencing and genotyping workflow is performed by Gencove technologies. The Detailed information about the Gencove algorithms and quality control protocols are available in Wasik et al. 2021, we briefly describe the key steps here.\nGencove’s workflow contains three steps: DNA extraction and library preparation, low-pass whole genome sequencing, and imputation analysis. Sequencing is performed at Neogen GeneSeek Laboratories using Illumina Novaseq at low-pass, targeting coverage levels of 0.5× and 1×. Whole-genome coverage is defined as the number of mapped DNA bases divided by the size of the genome (∼3 billion base pairs). We perform paired-end sequencing at length of 150-bp resulting in two FASTQ files (R1 and R2). Sequencing at paired-end mode significantly improves alignment to the genome. Next, the FASTQ files are aligned to the hs37-1kg reference genome, resulting in a BAM (Binary Alignment Map) file. In the sequence alignment procedure the DNA reads are mapped (in-pair) to the human genome reference sequence by similarity between the sequences. Lastly, loimpute-v0.1.0, Gencove’s imputation procedure, is used over the aligned reads. Imputation is done for the autosomal chromosomes (1-22) using The 1000 Genomes phase 3 haplotypes (1KGP3) as a reference panel, resulting in a VCF (Variant Call Format) file. The VCF contains the most likely genotype (GT) at 37,559,140 positions and their corresponding genotype probabilities (GP). Finally, Gencove employs quality control procedures to exclude samples with poor sequencing and genotyping results.\n\n\n\nData availability\n\nThe information is stored in a number of statistics parquet files: - human_genetics.parquet: sample metadata, including QC statistics, paths to PLINK variant files (raw and post-QC), and principal components (PCs). - variants_qc.parquet: variant QC statistics. - relationship/relationship_ibs.txt: IBS calculated by PLINK for pairs of participants. - relationship/relationship_king.tsv: King kinship coefficients for pairs of participants. - pca/pca.parquet: a PLINK file containing principal components. - pca/pca_loadings.tsv: a PLINK file containing principal component loadings calculated.\n\n\n\n\n\ngraph LR;\n    D[DNA extraction] --&gt;|sequencing| F(FASTQ) --&gt;|alignment| B(BAM) --&gt;|imputation| V(VCF)\n    H[REFERENCE HAPLOTYPES] --&gt;|imputation| V --&gt;|\"sample&lt;br&gt;aggregation\"| R(BED&lt;br&gt;raw) --&gt;|QC| Q(BED&lt;br&gt;post-qc)\n    Q --&gt; PCA(PCA)\n    Q --&gt; IBS(PLINK IBS&lt;br&gt;relationships)\n    Q --&gt; KING(KING&lt;br&gt;relationships)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary of available data\n\n\nRaw DNA data\nPheno provides per each sample all of the raw sequencing and genotyping workflow data, including FASTQ, BAM, VCF, and QC files.\n\nFASTQ files are the sequencing machine outputs. They are text files that store the DNA sequences and their corresponding quality scores. We perform the sequencing at paired-end mode, meaning that each DNA molecule is sequenced from both sides, therefore there are two FASTQ files (R1 and R2).\nBinary Alignment Map (BAM) files are a binary and indexed representation of sequence alignment results. The BAM file stores the position of the DNA reads in the reference genome and the corresponding mapping quality. Indexing is provided in the bam.bai file, and allows to retrieve alignments that overlap a specific location quickly.\nVariant Call Format (VCF) file is a text file used for storing genetic variations. VCF consists of a header and a table. The header provides metadata describing the table fields and their values. The FILTER field holds a flag indicating whether the variant has failed or successfully passed filters. The raw genotype data includes all 37M positions regardless of their FILTER flag status. Genotypes are flagged as ‘LOWCONF’ at the FILTER field if their maximum GP is less than 0.9, and otherwise flagged as ‘PASS’ quality check. The following FORMAT fields are provided in the VCF - GT:RC:AC:GP:DS (VCF specification). Please note that the data is unphased.\nPLINK binary biallelic genotype file - In addition to the single sample VCFs we also provide the raw genotype data of all samples jointly in PLINK bed format. Because of the large number of variants, we split the data to chromosomes (22 PLINK bed/bim/bam files). PLINK bed file is a compacted binary representation of genotypes at bi-allelic variants. It is accompanied by .bim and .fam files, which are the metadata files for variants and samples, respectively (PLINK specification).\nGencove QC file - Gencove performs quality control to exclude samples with poor sequencing and genotyping results. Gencove’s quality control matrices are included in the sample metadata.\n\nThe raw genotype data includes 34,580,532 SNPs and 2,978,606 short indels, 37,494,604 of the variants are bi-alleleic and 30,990 are multi-allelic. Multi-allelic variants are represented in variant normalization format, meaning each alternate allele is listed in a separate line, in both the VCFs and PLINK.\nNotably, we do not provide the raw data of samples who failed Gencove QC or for which we identify a possibility of DNA contamination or of mislabelling (i.e. DNA samples are associated with the wrong individual), as explained in section ‘Sample evaluation’.\n\n\nPost-genotyping QC data\n\nWe provide the QC genotyped data in PLINK format as explained above. The post-genotyping QC procedure resulted in genotypes for ~99.98% of total samples, and 5,770,633 variants that passed variant QC (~15.36% of the total variants).\nIn addition to the genotype data we provide auxiliary tabulated datasets such as : variants and sample QC metrics, principal component projection, and familial relationships estimates.\n\n\n\n\nRelevant links\n\nPheno Data

    "text": "Description\nMeasures of liver health from a liver ultrasound and 2D shear wave elastography (2D-SWE), including measures of viscosity, elasticity, attenuation, and sound speed.\n\n\nIntroduction\nLiver ultrasound was performed using the Supersonic Aixplorer MACH 30 (Hologic, USA). The Supersonic Imagine Aixplorer is an ultrasound device that is able to measure the liver’s stiffness, viscosity, attenuation and sound speed to diagnose and monitor liver conditions such as steatosis, fibrosis and inflammation. The device uses several ultrasound-based measures, including Speed of Sound (SSp.PLUS), Attenuation Index (Att.PLUS), Viscosity (Vi.PLUS) and Elasticity (Two-Dimensional ShareWave Elastography (2D-SWE)) to evaluate the liver and improve diagnosis performance. These measurements have been shown to be correlated to different stages of liver conditions.\nUltrasound-based liver measurements were performed using ShearWave Elastography (2D- SWE.PLUS) for elasticity assessment, sound speed Plane-wave ultrasound and attenuation. Plane-wave ultrasound was measured for assessment of liver steatosis (fatness) and viscosity plane-wave ultrasound for assessment of viscosity as a marker of inflammation. Measurements were performed with a C6-1X convex transducer using the UltraFast software available on the Mach 30 ultrasound system. US images of the liver were also saved.\n\n\nMeasurement protocol\n\nAll patients were examined in supine position, with the right arm elevated above the head, by an intercostal approach, in the right liver lobe. Acquisitions were performed during neutral respiratory apnea. Initially the Attenuation and Speed of Sound were measured from a homogeneous area of the liver parenchyma free of vessels or other structures. Measurements were performed from 3 different liver regions. 2D-SWE and viscosity were then measured from 3 different locations in an area of relative uniform elasticity, at a depth of 3–5 cm using stability index tool (SI) derived from the spatial and temporal stiffness stability at a stability index &gt;90%.\n\n\n\nLiver US example\n\n\n\n\nData availability\n\nThe information is stored in 2

This longitudinal tracking is essential for understanding when measurements were taken and how participants’ health evolves throughout the study.\nThe Human Phenotype Project is designed as a long-term longitudinal study with planned follow-up over many years. Participants initially visit the clinical testing center for comprehensive baseline assessments, and then return for follow-up visits and calls at regular intervals. Each event record includes:\n\nVisits to the clinical testing center: When participants come in person for measurements, tests, and sample collection\nFollow-up calls: Phone-based check-ins to update medical information and track health changes\nAge at assessment: Calculated from date of birth to the event date, crucial for age-adjusted analyses\nResearch stage: Identifies whether the event is baseline, first follow-up, second follow-up, etc.\n\nThis temporal framework enables researchers to: - Track changes in health status over time - Link measurements taken at the same visit across different modalities - Calculate time-varying variables such as age at measurement - Study disease progression and health trajectories - Assess the impact of interventions or life events on health outcomes\n\n\nMeasurement protocol\n\nUpon registration to the Human Phenotype Project, people are assigned with a registration code, which is their ID in the study and provide a telephone number and email by which all communications are conducted. Participants are asked about their date of birth and their sex, and are asked to schedule a visit to the assessment center.\nPersonal and communication data is saved separately in a secure environment from the population characteristics information, which is saved with the participant designated ID.\n\n\nData availability\n\n\nevents.parquet - contains information regarding participant visits and calls and study_ids.\n\n\n\nSummary of available data\n\n\nParticipant ID - assigned to participants upon registration.\nStudy ID - the ID of the study.\nVisit dates - dates of calls/visits to the assessment center.\nDate of birth - only month and year of birth should be available.\nSex of the participants.\nAge at research stage - calculated age of the participant at each research stage/event.\n\n\n\nRelevant links\n\nPheno Data Browser\n\n\nfrom pheno_utils import PhenoLoader\n\n\npl = PhenoLoader('events')\npl\n\nPhenoLoader for events with\n10 fields\n1 tables: ['events']\n\n\n\n\nData dictionary\n\npl.dict\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfield_string\ndescription_string\nfolder_id\nfeature_set\nfield_type\nstrata\ndata_coding\narray\npandas_dtype\nbulk_file_extension\nrelative_location\nunits\nbulk_dictionary\nsampling_rate\ntransformation\nlist_of_tags\nstability\nsexed\ndebut\ncompleted\n\n\ntabular_field_name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmonth_of_birth\nMonth of birth\nMonth of birth\n1\nevents\nCategorical (single)\nPrimary\n042_03\nSingle\ncategory\nNaN\nevents/events.parquet\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nAccruing\nBoth sexes\n2019-01-01\nNaN\n\n\nyear_of_birth\nYear of birth\nYear of birth\n1\nevents\nInteger\nPrimary\nNaN\nSingle\nint\nNaN\nevents/events.parquet\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nAccruing\nBoth sexes\n2019-01-01\nNaN\n\n\nsex\nSex\nSex\n1\nevents\nCategorical (single)\nPrimary\n9\nSingle\ncategory\nNaN\nevents/events.parquet\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nAccruing\nBoth sexes\n2019-01-01\nNaN\n\n\nresearch_stage_type\nResearch stage type\nThe type of the research stage\n1\nevents\nCategorical (single)\nPrimary\n001_01\nSingle\ncategory\nNaN\nevents/events.parquet\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nAccruing\nBoth sexes\n2019-01-01\nNaN\n\n\nvisit_center\nVisit center\nThe name of the assessment center\n1\nevents\nCategorical (single)\nPrimary\n001_02\nSingle\ncategory\nNaN\nevents/events.parquet\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nAccruing\nBoth sexes\n2019-01-01\nNaN\n\n\nresearch_stage_timestamp\nTimestamp of research stage\nThe timestamp of the research stage.

    "text": "Description\nCarotid intima–media thickness computed from carotid ultrasound imaging.\n\n\nIntroduction\nCarotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) measurement is an ultrasound-based technique used to assess the thickness of the innermost two layers of the carotid artery, known as the intima and media. These layers can become thickened due to atherosclerotic processes or due to age. The thickening of the intima-media layer can be throughout the length of the artery (increased IMT) or as local accumulation of fatty deposits that penetrate into the vessel interior known as plaques. Advanced plaques can cause stenosis of the artery. Carotid IMT is increasingly used as an indicator of early atherosclerosis and a predictor for cardiovascular events and can be used for identifying asymptomatic patients at high risk who might be candidates for more intensive medical interventions. Measurement of CIMT with B-mode ultrasound is a noninvasive, sensitive, and reproducible technique for identifying and quantifying subclinical vascular disease and for evaluating CVD risk.\nThe ultrasound probe is placed on the skin over the carotid artery and high-frequency sound waves are used to produce images of the artery. These images are then analyzed using an automatic detection algorithm to measure the thickness of the intima and media layers.\n\n\nMeasurement protocol\n\nCarotid US was performed using the Supersonic Aixplorer MACH 30 (Hologic, USA). Carotid Intima Media (CIMT) was measured using the L10-2 transducer from both carotid arteries while the subject in supine position with head rotated to the opposite side of the measured artery. Evaluation was performed using an automatic computerized system (Aixplorer Mach 30). The intima and media are automatically traced within the box of interest. Mean CIMT was recorded over a length of 1 cm at the far wall of each carotid artery. One measurement was obtained from each carotid artery. Only parts of the carotid artery without plaques were included in the IMT analysis.\n\n\n\nIMT example\n\n\n\n\nData availability\n\nThe information is stored in 1 parquet file: carotid_ultrasound.parquet\n\n\nSummary of available data\n\n\nUltrasound images of the left and right carotid arteries.\nDICOM files of the test.\nRight and left Intima Media Thickness.\nPercentages of fit and width of the box of interest for which the IMT is calculated.\n\n\n\nRelevant links\n\nPheno Data Browser\n\n\nfrom pheno_utils import PhenoLoader\n\n\npl = PhenoLoader('carotid_ultrasound')\npl\n\nPhenoLoader for carotid_ultrasound with\n11 fields\n2 tables: ['carotid_ultrasound', 'age_sex']\n\n\n\n\nData dictionary\n\npl.dict\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfield_string\ndescription_string\nfolder_id\nfeature_set\nfield_type\nstrata\ndata_coding\narray\npandas_dtype\nbulk_file_extension\nrelative_location\nunits\nbulk_dictionary\nsampling_rate\ntransformation\nlist_of_tags\nstability\nsexed\ndebut\ncompleted\n\n\ntabular_field_name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntimezone\nTimezone\nTimezone at collection\n12\ncarotid_ultrasound\nCategorical (single)\nCollection time\n001_03\nSingle\ncategory\nNaN\ncarotid_ultrasound/carotid_ultrasound.parquet\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nAccruing\nBoth sexes\n2021-08-16\nNaN\n\n\ncollection_date\nCollection date (YYYY-MM-DD)\nCollection date (YYYY-MM-DD)\n12\ncarotid_ultrasound\nDate\nCollection time\nNaN\nSingle\ndatetime64[ns]\nNaN\ncarotid_ultrasound/carotid_ultrasound.parquet\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nAccruing\nBoth sexes\n2021-08-16\nNaN\n\n\ncollection_timestamp\nCollection timestamp\nCollection timestamp\n12\ncarotid_ultrasound\nDatetime\nCollection time\nNaN\nSingle\ndatetime64[ns, Asia/Jerusalem]\nNaN\ncarotid_ultrasound/carotid_ultrasound.parquet\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nAccruing\nBoth sexes\n2021-08-16\nNaN\n\n\nimt_left\nIntima media thickness (left)\nIntima Media Thickness (IMT) measurement is an...\n12\ncarotid_ultrasound\nContinuous\nPrimary\nNaN\nSingle\nfloat\nNaN\ncarotid_ultrasound/carotid_ultrasound.parquet\nmm\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nAccruing\nBoth sexes\n2021-08-16\nNaN\n\n\nimt_right\nIntima media thickness (right)\nIntima Media Thickness (IMT) measurement is an...\n12\ncarotid_ultrasound\nContinuous\nPrimary\nNaN\nSingle\nfloat\nNaN\ncarotid_ultrasound/carotid_ultrasound.parquet\nmm\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nAccruing\nBoth sexes\n2021-08-16\nNaN\n\n\nimt_window_width_left\nIMT window width (left)\nIndicates the width if the box of interest\n12\ncarotid_ultrasound\nContinuous\nAuxiliary\nNaN\nSingle\nfloat\nNaN\ncarotid_ultrasound/carotid_ultrasound.parquet\nmm\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nAccruing\nBoth sexes\n2021-08-16\nNaN\n\n\nimt_window_width_right\nIMT window width (right)\nIndicates the width if the box of interest\n12\ncarotid_ultrasound\nContinuous\nAuxiliary\nNaN\nSingle\nfloat\nNaN\ncarotid_ultrasound/carotid_ultrasound.parquet\nmm\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nAccruing\nBoth sexes\n2021-08-16\nNaN\n\n\nimt_fit_left\nIntima media thickness Fit (left)\nPercentage of the box of interest for which th...\n12\ncarotid_ultrasound\nContinuous\nAuxiliary\nNaN\nSingle\nfloat\nNaN\ncarotid_ultrasound/carotid_ultrasound.parquet\n%\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nAccruing\nBoth sexes\n2021-08-16\nNaN\n\n\nimt_fit_right\nIntima media thickness Fit (right)\nPercentage of the box of interest for which th...\n12\ncarotid_ultrasound\nContinuous\nAuxiliary\nNaN\nSingle\nfloat\nNaN\ncarotid_ultrasound/carotid_ultrasound.parquet\n%\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nAccruing\nBoth sexes\n2021-08-16\nNaN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot histogram and ecdf for imt_left at baseline visit\n\nfrom pheno_utils.basic_plots import hist_ecdf_plots\n\ncol = \"imt_left\"\ndf = pl[[col] + [\"age\", \"sex\", \"collection_date\"]].loc[:,:,\"00_00_visit\",0,:]\n\n# plot histogram and ecdf\nhist_ecdf_plots(df.dropna(subset=[col,\"sex\", \"age\"]), col, gender_col=\"sex\")\n\n# stats\ndisplay(df[col].describe().to_frame().T)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncount\nmean\nstd\nmin\n25%\n50%\n75%\nmax\n\n\n\n\nimt_left\n6291.0\n0.60545\n0.121213\n0.4\n0.517\n0.586\n0.67\n1.29",

ABI is a ratio of the blood pressure in the ankle to the blood pressure in the arm. PWV, is the speed at which the pulse wave of the blood pressure travels along the wall of an artery or a combined length of arteries.\n\n\nIntroduction\nABI and PWV are measured in the Human Phenotype Project to assess vascular health. ABI is a ratio of the systolic blood pressure in the ankle to the systolic blood pressure in the arm. PWV is the speed at which the pulse wave of the blood pressure travels along the wall of an artery or a combined length of arteries.\n\nABI\nAnkle-Brachial Index (ABI) measurements were conducted using the Falcon (Viasonix, Israel) device while subjects were in supine position. During the ABI test, primary systolic pressures are measured in each of the right and left brachial arteries, and right and left ankles. ABI is determined as the ratio between the brachial systolic pressure and the ankle pressure on each side providing ABI values per each side. The systolic pressures were based on a combination of blood pressure cuffs and blood flow reading with photoplethysmograph (PPG) sensors placed on the measured limb fingers. Under normal circumstances, the blood pressure in the ankle will be very similar or identical to that measured in the arm, so the measured ABI value will be close to 1. In the case of peripheral arterial disease, there will be a discrepancy - the blood pressure at the ankle will be lower than the blood pressure in the arms. This will indicate insufficiency in the arteries that carry blood to the legs. In the general population, PAD affects about 10% of people over the age of 55.\n\n\nPWV\nPulse wave velocity (PWV) is considered a surrogate marker for arterial stiffness/elasticity, which is correlated with vascular disease (REF). Vascular elasticity is important for the normal vascular function for attenuation and smoothing of the pulsation intensity and blood flow. With age, and in combination with atherosclerosis processes, blood vessels may lose their elasticity and become stiff. Increased arterial stiffness can predict future vascular system problems.The contractions of the heart generate arterial blood pressure pulse waves which propagate through the arterial walls. PWV is defined as the velocity at which these arterial blood pressure pulses propagate. PWV is a quantitative parameter reflecting arterial stiffness. Higher PWV values reflect greater than normal arterial stiffness. While there is no one set standard of how or where to measure PWV, some of the more common PWV measurements include the baPWV, which reflects the pulse wave propagation between the brachial and ankle, cfPWV reflecting propagation between the carotid and femoral, and faPWV also know as leg PWV reflecting the PWV along the leg between the femoral and ankle. In the HPP we measure leg PWV (faPWV). PWV is highly dependent on the method of measurement, as well as on the measurement sites. Therefore, typical values for baPWV differ from faPWV and cfPWV. Based on literature reports, normal PWV values can range between around 6 m/s to 14 m/s, depending on the method of measurement, location and the patient’s age. For example, according to Laurent et al. the PWV increases from 4–5 m/s in the ascending aorta to 5–6 m/s in the abdominal aorta then 8–9 m/s in the iliac and femoral arteries (Laurent et al. European Heart Journal (2006) 27, 2588–2605)\nPWV has been recognized as an indicator of organ damage and a useful additional test in the investigation of high blood pressure, it is also a useful method for prediction of cardiovascular events and mortality. Studies have also shown that ABI is a reliable predictor of cardiovascular disease and mortality in patients with peripheral artery disease.\n\n\n\nMeasurement protocol\n\nMeasuring the systolic blood pressure with the Falcon is based on a combination of both blood pressure cuffs and a Photoplethysmograph (PPG) sensor. A blood pressure cuff is wrapped around the measured site, and a distal PPG waveform is obtained by the PPG sensor. Firstly, the cuff is inflated until the distal signal disappears as a result of the total occlusion (The cuff produces higher pressure than the artery). Secondly, the blood pressure cuff is deflated in a controlled manner, and the cuff pressure at which the distal signal re-appears is determined as the systolic pressure of the artery (will occur after pressure equalization between the cuff and the artery).\nThe measurement of PWV is based on the definition of velocity, i.e., distance divided by time. The initial systolic upstroke serves as a time marker. When the arterial pulse wave propagates along with the arterial circulation, there is a short time delay between the proximal and the distal measurement sites, i.e the propagation time between them. The distance between the two measurements is measured directly using a measurement tape. The measurement is performed with the aid of blood pressure cuffs. These cuffs are wrapped around the ankle and thigh.\n\n\n\nvascular\n\n\n\n\nData availability\n\nThe information is stored in 1 parquet file: vascular_health.parquet\n\n\nSummary of available data\n\n\nABI and PWV measurements: A data frame of computed features provided by the manufacturer based on the above channels\n\n\n\nRelevant links\n\nPheno Data Browser\n\n\nfrom pheno_utils import PhenoLoader\n\n\npl = PhenoLoader('vascular_health')\npl\n\nPhenoLoader for vascular_health with\n13 fields\n2 tables: ['vascular_health', 'age_sex']\n\n\n\n\nData dictionary\n\npl.dict\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfield_string\ndescription_string\nfolder_id\nfeature_set\nfield_type\nstrata\ndata_coding\narray\npandas_dtype\nbulk_file_extension\nrelative_location\nunits\nbulk_dictionary\nsampling_rate\ntransformation\nlist_of_tags\nstability\nsexed\ndebut\ncompleted\n\n\ntabular_field_name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncollection_timestamp\nCollection timestamp\nCollection timestamp\n10\nvascular_health\nDatetime\nCollection time\nNaN\nSingle\ndatetime64[ns, Asia/Jerusalem]\nNaN\nvascular_health/vascular_health.parquet\nTime\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nBlood pressure, ABI, PWV, Cardio\nAccruing\nBoth sexes\n2019-01-29\nNaN\n\n\ncollection_date\nCollection date (YYYY-MM-DD)\nDate\n10\nvascular_health\nDate\nCollection time\nNaN\nSingle\ndatetime64[ns]\nNaN\nvascular_health/vascular_health.parquet\nTime\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nBlood pressure, ABI, PWV, Cardio\nAccruing\nBoth sexes\n2019-01-29\nNaN\n\n\ntimezone\nTimezone\nTimezone\n10\nvascular_health\nCategorical (single)\nCollection time\n001_03\nSingle\ncategory\nNaN\nvascular_health/vascular_health.parquet\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\n2019-01-29\nNaN\n\n\nr_ankle_pressure\nRight ankle pressure\nSystolic pressure value in the right ankle\n10\nvascular_health\nContinuous\nPrimary\nNaN\nSingle\nfloat\nNaN\nvascular_health/vascular_health.parquet\nmmHg\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nBlood pressure, ABI, PWV, Cardio\nAccruing\nBoth sexes\n2019-01-29\nNaN\n\n\nl_ankle_pressure\nLeft ankle pressure\nSystolic pressure value in the left ankle\n10\nvascular_health\nContinuous\nPrimary\nNaN\nSingle\nfloat\nNaN\nvascular_health/vascular_health.parquet\nmmHg\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nBlood pressure, ABI, PWV, Cardio\nAccruing\nBoth sexes\n2019-01-29\nNaN\n\n\nr_brachial_pressure\nRight brachial pressure\nSystolic pressure value in the right brachial\n10\nvascular_health\nContinuous\nPrimary\nNaN\nSingle\nfloat\nNaN\nvascular_health/vascular_health.parquet\nmmHg\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nBlood pressure, ABI, PWV, Cardio\nAccruing\nBoth sexes\n2019-01-29\nNaN\n\n\nl_brachial_pressure\nLeft brachial pressure\nSystolic pressure value in the left brachial\n10\nvascular_health\nContinuous\nPrimary\nNaN\nSingle\nfloat\nNaN\nvascular_health/vascular_health.parquet\nmmHg\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nBlood pressure, ABI, PWV, Cardio\nAccruing\nBoth sexes\n2019-01-29\nNaN\n\n\nr_abi\nRight ABI\nABI in the left side (right ankle to right bra...\n10\nvascular_health\nContinuous\nPrimary\nNaN\nSingle\nfloat\nNaN\nvascular_health/vascular_health.parquet\nratio\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nBlood pressure, ABI, PWV, Cardio\nAccruing\nBoth sexes\n2019-01-29\nNaN\n\n\nl_abi\nLeft ABI\nABI in the right side (left ankle to left brac...\n10\nvascular_health\nContinuous\nPrimary\nNaN\nSingle\nfloat\nNaN\nvascular_health/vascular_health.parquet\nratio\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nBlood pressure, ABI, PWV, Cardio\nAccruing\nBoth sexes\n2019-01-29\nNaN\n\n\nfrom_r_thigh_to_r_ankle_pwv\nPWV (from right thigh to right ankle)\nPulse Wave Velocity\n10\nvascular_health\nContinuous\nPrimary\nNaN\nSingle\nfloat\nNaN\nvascular_health/vascular_health.parquet\nm/s\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nBlood pressure, ABI, PWV, Cardio\nAccruing\nBoth sexes\n2019-01-29\nNaN\n\n\nfrom_l_thigh_to_l_ankle_pwv\nPWV (from left thigh to left ankle)\nCalculated left leg PWV\n10\nvascular_health\nContinuous\nPrimary\nNaN\nSingle\nfloat\nNaN\nvascular_health/vascular_health.parquet\nm/s\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nBlood pressure, ABI, PWV, Cardio\nAccruing\nBoth sexes\n2019-01-29\nNaN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot histogram and ecdf for r_abi at baseline visit\n\nfrom pheno_utils.basic_plots import hist_ecdf_plots\n\ncol = \"r_abi\"\ndf = pl[[col] + [\"age\", \"sex\", \"collection_date\"]].loc[:,:,\"00_00_visit\",0,:]\n\n# plot histogram and ecdf\nhist_ecdf_plots(df.dropna(subset=[col,\"sex\", \"age\"]), col, gender_col=\"sex\")\n\n# stats\ndisplay(df[col].describe().to_frame().T)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncount\nmean\nstd\nmin\n25%\n50%\n75%\nmax\n\n\n\n\nr_abi\n8850.0\n1.126168\n0.148586\n0.31\n1.04\n1.13\n1.22\n2.24",

    "text": "Description\nSociodemographic data encompasses social, economic, and demographic characteristics of study participants that influence health outcomes and provide important context for interpreting health data. This includes information about ancestry and migration history, education, employment, household composition, living conditions, and socioeconomic status. These factors are essential for understanding health disparities, environmental exposures, and social determinants of health.\n\n\nIntroduction\nThe Human Phenotype Project conducts comprehensive data collection through online surveys, where participants voluntarily provide information on various aspects influencing their health. This includes sociodemographic data, captured through two lifestyle surveys (Inital UKBB and Follow-up UKBB survey) and the Initial Medical Survey.\n\n\nMeasurement protocol\n\nThese lifestyle surveys are modeled after the UK Biobank’s touch screen questionnaire. Participants receive the full version via email to complete on an online platform, either before or after their baseline visit. A shorter, follow-up version of the questionnaire is then filled out by participants during subsequent visits.\n\n\nData availability\n\nThe information is stored in 2 parquet files: initial_medical.parquet and ukbb.parquet which contain the different data sources respectively the Initial Medical Survey and the two lifestyle surveys (Inital UKBB and Follow-up UKBB survey).\n\n\nSummary of available data\n\nThe sociodemographic dataset includes comprehensive information organized into several categories:\nAncestry and Migration: - Participant’s country of birth and year of immigration (aliya) - Parents’ countries of birth - Grandparents’ countries of birth (both maternal and paternal sides)\nEducation and Qualifications: - Highest level of education attained - Professional qualifications - Age at completion of full-time education\nEmployment: - Current employment status - Duration in main current job (years and months) - Length of working day - Job characteristics (walking/standing, manual labor, shift work, night shifts) - Commuting patterns (frequency, transport type, distance, duration) - Remote work frequency\nHousehold and Living Conditions: - Type of accommodation - Heating and air conditioning availability - Length of residence at current address - Household size and relationships between household members - Number of vehicles in household - Current and past pet ownership (type of pets) - Residence area type (urban/rural) - Assisted living status\nSocioeconomic Status: - Average total household income after tax - Extra domestic job hours\nFamily Connections: - Family members participating in the study (participant IDs and relationship degrees) - Household members participating in the study\nMilitary Service (for Israeli population): - Past military service - Position and duration of service\nThis comprehensive sociodemographic data enables researchers to examine how social and economic factors interact with health outcomes and to account for these variables in analyses.\n\n\nRelevant links\n\nPheno Data Browser\n\n\nfrom pheno_utils import PhenoLoader\n\n\npl =

It is asked in-person, in every visit to the clinical testing center. Questions asked are related to the participant’s vaccination status, number of vaccine doses and boosters, were participants diagnosed with Covid-19 in the past and were they hospitalized following diagnosis.\n\n\nMeasurement protocol\n\nParticipants are asked the COVID survey questions during the visit to the clinical testing center (CTC) both at baseline and on follow up visits. It is asked in person, and answers are filled into the system by study coordinators.\n\n\nData availability\n\nThe information is stored in 1 parquet file: covid.parquet. The ‘data source’ column indicates which survey the information comes from either the initial Covid survey or the Follow-up Medical Survey.\n\n\nSummary of available data\n\nThe processed data is saved as a pandas DataFrame. Each question is stored in a single column. All question answers are coded as integers, according to the question code that can be found in the Covid survey data dictionary.

    "text": "Description\nHand grip strength (HGS) is an effective marker of general health in middle age and older adulthood. Grip strength is measured by squeezing a type of muscle strength testing equipment, known as a dynamometer.\n\n\nIntroduction\nHGS is a measure of the maximum force that an individual can exert with their hand. It is a widely used measure of muscular strength. HGS is an easy and quick measure to obtain.\nIn a clinical setting, HGS is often used as a measure to assess changes in muscle strength over time. For example, in patients with conditions such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, or sarcopenia. Additionally, HGS can be used to assess the effectiveness of rehabilitation programs, such as those used to recover from a stroke or from other neurological conditions.\nHGS is also used in research studies to investigate the relationship between muscle strength and various health outcomes, such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), respiratory function, and mortality. Studies have shown that low HGS is associated with increased risk of these and other health conditions, highlighting the importance of this measure in identifying individuals at risk for these conditions. Low HGS can be a warning sign of frailty, especially in older adults, as well as muscle wasting and weakness. Based on this, HGS can be used as a simple, non-invasive, and inexpensive method to predict physical frailty and disability.\n\n\nMeasurement protocol\n\nHGS is measured using a Jamar Hydraulic Hand Dynamometer (see figure below). The measurement is a measure of the static force (without movement) that the hand can exert when squeezing around the dynamometer. The measurement is recorded in pounds initially, and then converted to kilograms.\n\n\n\nimage alt\n\n\nThe participant is asked to sit upright in a chair with the arm bent at a 90° angle so that their forearm is pointing forward, with their thumb uppermost. The participant is asked to hold the device first in their dominant hand and adjust the handle of the dynamometer as necessary, ensuring the base rests on the first metacarpal and the handle on the middle of the four fingers. The participant is asked to squeeze the handle of the dynamometer for at least 3 seconds. The results are manually recorded, and then the measurement is repeated for the non-dominant hand.\n\n\nData availability\n\nThe information is stored in 1 parquet file: hand_grip.parquet\n\n\nSummary of available data\n\n\nRaw data: a data frame containing individual level hand grip strength measurements.\n\n\n\nRelevant links\n\nPheno Data Browser\n\n\nfrom pheno_utils import PhenoLoader\n\n\npl = PhenoLoader('hand_grip')\npl\n\nPhenoLoader for hand_grip with\n10 fields\n2 tables: ['hand_grip', 'age_sex']\n\n\n\n\nData dictionary\n\npl.dict\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfield_string\ndescription_string\nfolder_id\nfeature_set\nfield_type\nstrata\ndata_coding\narray\npandas_dtype\nbulk_file_extension\nrelative_location\nunits\nbulk_dictionary\nsampling_rate\ntransformation\nlist_of_tags\nstability\nsexed\ndebut\ncompleted\n\n\ntabular_field_name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncollection_date\nCollection date (YYYY-MM-DD)\nCollection date (YYYY-MM-DD)\n6\nhand_grip\nDate\nCollection time\nNaN\nSingle\ndatetime64[ns]\nNaN\nhand_grip/hand_grip.parquet\nTime\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nAccruing\nBoth sexes\n2018-10-18\nNaN\n\n\ncollection_timestamp\nCollection timestamp\nCollection timestamp\n6\nhand_grip\nDatetime\nCollection time\nNaN\nSingle\ndatetime64[ns, Asia/Jerusalem]\nNaN\nhand_grip/hand_grip.parquet\nTime\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nAccruing\nBoth sexes\n2018-10-18\n2019-11-13\n\n\nfinger_grip_strength_left\nFinger grip strength (left)\nFinger grip strength (left)\n6\nhand_grip\nContinuous\nPrimary\nNaN\nSingle\nfloat\nNaN\nhand_grip/hand_grip.parquet\nkg\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nComplete\nBoth sexes\n2018-10-18\n2019-11-13\n\n\nfinger_grip_strength_right\nFinger grip strength (right)\nFinger grip strength (right)\n6\nhand_grip\nContinuous\nPrimary\nNaN\nSingle\nfloat\nNaN\nhand_grip/hand_grip.parquet\nkg\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nComplete\nBoth sexes\n2018-10-18\nNaN\n\n\ndominant_hand\nDominant hand\nHand preference for fine motor tasks\n6\nhand_grip\nCategorical (single)\nPrimary\n007_01\nSingle\ncategory\nNaN\nhand_grip/hand_grip.parquet\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nAccruing\nBoth sexes\n2018-10-18\nNaN\n\n\nhand_grip_strength_left\nHand grip strength (left)\nHand grip strength (left)\n6\nhand_grip\nContinuous\nPrimary\nNaN\nSingle\nfloat\nNaN\nhand_grip/hand_grip.parquet\nkg\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nAccruing\nBoth sexes\n2018-10-18\nNaN\n\n\nhand_grip_strength_right\nHand grip strength (right)\nHand grip strength (right)\n6\nhand_grip\nContinuous\nPrimary\nNaN\nSingle\nfloat\nNaN\nhand_grip/hand_grip.parquet\nkg\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nAccruing\nBoth sexes\n2018-10-18\nNaN\n\n\ntimezone\nTimezone\nTimezone\n6\nhand_grip\nCategorical (single)\nCollection time\nNaN\nSingle\nstring\nNaN\nhand_grip/hand_grip.parquet\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nAccruing\nBoth sexes\n2018-10-18\nNaN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot histogram and ecdf for hand_grip_strength_left at baseline visit\n\nfrom pheno_utils.basic_plots import hist_ecdf_plots\n\ncol = \"hand_grip_strength_left\"\ndf = pl[[col] + [\"age\", \"sex\", \"collection_date\"]].loc[:,:,\"00_00_visit\",0,:]\n\n# plot histogram and ecdf\nhist_ecdf_plots(df.dropna(subset=[col,\"sex\", \"age\"]), col, gender_col=\"sex\")\n\n# stats\ndisplay(df[col].describe().to_frame().T)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncount\nmean\nstd\nmin\n25%\n50%\n75%\nmax\n\n\n\n\nhand_grip_strength_left\n10336.0\n34.177962\n11.432727\n2.358683\n25.083688\n31.638105\n43.091326\n79.061244",

    "text": "Description\nLifestyle and environmental factors encompass a wide range of influences on an individual’s health and well-being. These factors include behaviors such as physical activity patterns, sleep habits, smoking and alcohol consumption, dietary choices, sun exposure, and screen time, as well as environmental exposures like living conditions and commuting patterns. Together, they play a crucial role in determining overall health outcomes, impacting both the prevention and progression of diseases. Understanding these modifiable factors is essential for identifying opportunities for health interventions and for studying how daily behaviors and environmental contexts contribute to long-term health trajectories.\n\n\nIntroduction\nThe Human Phenotype Project conducts comprehensive data collection through online surveys, where participants voluntarily provide information on various aspects influencing their health. This includes lifestyle and enviroment data, captured through two lifestyle surveys.\n\n\nMeasurement protocol\n\nThese lifestyle surveys are modeled after the UK Biobank’s touch screen questionnaire. Participants receive the full version via email to complete on the Zoho platform, either before or after their baseline visit. A shorter, follow-up version of the questionnaire is then filled out by participants during subsequent visits.\n\n\nData availability\n\nThe information is stored in 1 parquet file: lifestyle_and_environment.parquet\n\n\nSummary of available data\n\nThe lifestyle and environment dataset captures comprehensive information across multiple domains:\nPhysical Activity: - Walking frequency, duration, and usual pace - Moderate and vigorous physical activity patterns (frequency and duration) - Specific activities including stair climbing, walking for pleasure, strenuous sports, and other exercises - Categorization by intensity levels (mild, moderate, high exercise) - Transportation modes used excluding work commute\nSleep and Circadian Patterns: - Sleep duration and quality - Morning/evening chronotype preferences - Getting up patterns in the morning - Daytime napping and dozing habits - Sleeplessness and insomnia indicators - Snoring frequency\nTobacco Use: - Current and past smoking status - Age started and stopped smoking - Type of tobacco used (cigarettes, cigars, pipes) - Quantity smoked (daily cigarette consumption) - Smoking cessation attempts and success - Time from waking to first cigarette - Changes in smoking patterns over time - Exposure to secondhand smoke at home and outside home - Household smoking environment\nAlcohol Consumption: - Drinking frequency and patterns - Detailed intake of different alcohol types (red wine, white wine, beer, cider, spirits, fortified wine) - Alcohol consumption with meals - Changes in drinking patterns over time - Former drinker status and reasons for stopping\nDietary Habits: - Intake frequency of vegetables (cooked and raw), fruits (fresh and dried) - Fish consumption (oily and non-oily) - Meat intake (processed, poultry, beef, lamb, pork) - Vegetarian status and age when stopped eating meat - Dairy and cheese consumption patterns - Bread, cereal, and spread types and intake - Hot beverage consumption (tea, coffee) and temperature preferences - Water intake - Salt added to food - Dietary restrictions (eggs, dairy, wheat, sugar) - Major dietary changes and dietary variation patterns - Kosher dietary practices - Fat types used in cooking\nScreen Time and Technology Use: - Television watching duration - Computer use time - Mobile phone usage patterns and duration - Usual side of head for phone use - Driving time and driving behaviors (speed patterns)\nEnvironmental and Sun Exposure: - Time spent outdoors (summer and winter) - Skin characteristics (color, ease of tanning) - Childhood sunburn history - Natural hair color\nHousehold and Living Environment: - Residence type and heating/cooling systems - Pet ownership (current and past)\nThis comprehensive assessment of lifestyle and environmental factors enables research into how daily behaviors, habits, and environmental contexts influence health outcomes and disease risk.\n\n\nRelevant links\n\nPheno Data

    "text": "Description\n\nMetagenomics is the study of genetic material from environmental samples, including microbial communities. It involves sequencing the DNA of all microorganisms in the sample, rather than isolating individual organisms. Metagenomics enables the identification and functional analysis of microorganisms in diverse environments, including soil, water, and the human body.\nThis dataset maps out the human gut microbiota per participant via shotgun metagenomic sequencing given stool samples. It is then compared to known references of gut flora to measure prevalence of specific microbes.\n\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe human gut, a complex and dynamic ecosystem, harbors a myriad of microorganisms collectively known as the gut microbiome. This community plays a critical role in various physiological processes such as immune modulation, metabolic regulation, and even functions as an endocrine organ. However, the vast complexity and diversity of the gut microbiome have remained largely elusive due to traditional culture methods’ limitations. Recent advances in next-generation sequencing technologies, particularly metagenomics, have paved the way for a more comprehensive understanding of the gut microbiome.\nGut metagenomics refers to the study of the collective genetic material of all microorganisms present in the gut, gleaned directly from fecal samples. It provides a powerful tool for the identification and quantification of diverse microbial species and their functional roles, including their influence on metabolic pathways, their virulence factors, antibiotic resistance profiles, and more. Moreover, gut metagenomics can reveal the taxonomic diversity and community structure of the microbiome, offering insights into the intricate relationship between the microbiome and its host.\n\n\nMeasurement protocol\n\nTo measure the genetic makeup of the human gut flora given stool samples via metagenomics, the following steps done:\n\nCollection of stool sample: For each visit, a stool sample is collected from the individual and stored appropriately to preserve the microbial community.\nDNA extraction: DNA is extracted from the stool sample using specialized techniques to isolate the microbial DNA from other materials present in the sample.\nDNA fragmentation and sequencing: The extracted DNA is then fragmented into small pieces and sequenced using high-throughput sequencing technologies.\nQuality control: The resulting raw sequencing data is then pre-processed, removing low-quality reads and artifacts of the sequencing methodology.\nTaxonomic classification: The processed sequencing data is then compared to databases of known microbial sequences to identify and classify the microbial species presence and their respective abundances in the sample.\n\n\n\nData availability\n\nThe information is stored in multiple parquet files:\n\ngut_microbiome.parquet: Sequencing and QC statistics.\nurs: Segal Lab relative abundance.\nmetaphlan_*: 8 tables with MetaPhlAn 4 relative abundances, separated by taxonomic levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngraph LR;\n    A(Raw FASTQ File) --&gt;

    "text": "Description\nSmartphone apps and wearable devices for monitoring physical activity and other health behaviors have gained popularity in recent years, offering a largely untapped source of data on health behaviors in real-world settings. This data is vast, collected at a low cost in natural environments, and often recorded automatically, making it a powerful supplement to traditional surveillance studies and controlled trials.\nThis dataset includes anonymized health and fitness data gathered from users of Google Fit and Apple HealthKit. It encompasses various categories such as body measurements (weight, height), physical activity (steps, exercise duration), nutrition, sleep patterns, heart rate, and cardiovascular health metrics. Apple HealthKit extends data collection to include more extensive medical and health-related information. Both platforms collect data through wearable devices and self-reported inputs, providing a comprehensive view of users’ health and lifestyles.\n\n\nIntroduction\nGoogle Fit is a fitness tracking platform that was released in October 2014. It is an open ecosystem that currently supports Android 4.1 and higher. It reads, gathers, and stores users’ data obtained via wearable gadgets and self-reporting.\nHealthKit (Apple Health) is Apple’s health data collection and visualization platform that was released in 2014 for iPhone with iOS 8+. The Health app collects and visualizes user data received from Apple Watch, smartphones, and self-reported inputs. HealthKit is a framework with an API that allows displaying the health data collected by apps and wearables that are connected to the Health app.\n\nKey Differences\n\nPlatform compatibility: Google Fit works with any platform, whereas Health is an iOS-only app (therefore, data from Health, specifically, is for iOS devices only).\nClinical use: Google Fit APIs are meant for creating fitness apps and should not be used for creating clinical solutions. Google Fit cannot be used with medical devices or as a digital therapeutic. HealthKit is built to help develop digital therapeutics — apps that can be used for patients’ treatment.\nData storage: Google Fit stores data in the cloud, whereas Health and HealthKit save it on the user’s device.\n\n\n\n\nMeasurement protocol\n\nWhen users download the HPP app under instruction during their visit to the clinical testing center (CTC), they are asked to give permission to share the wearable data from either Google Fit or Apple Health. The current Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for mobile app use instructions during the visit to the CTC is available through the internal documentation system.\n\nData Collection Methods\n\nGoogle Fit: Gathers data through wearable devices and self-reporting, supporting a variety of devices and platforms, and stores user data in the cloud for synchronization across devices.\nApple HealthKit: Collects data from Apple Watch sensors and self-reported inputs, exclusive to iOS devices, and saves data locally on the user’s device to enhance privacy and security.\n\nEthical considerations such as user consent and data anonymization are maintained to protect privacy and comply with data protection regulations, ensuring the dataset is suitable for research while respecting user rights.\n\n\n\nData availability\n\nThe data comprises three levels of processing:\n\nRaw data: Many data frames of temporal data and tabular data from various sensors and self-reported inputs\nDaily summary statistics: Data frames of computed summary features from the raw data which summarize the data at a daily level\nSummary statistics: Data frames which show high-level summary features computed at the participant research stage level\n\nData is available from 2 sources: Apple Health and Google Fit. Each of these sources has multiple versions and features stored in separate parquet files.\n\n\nSummary of available data\n\nThe data is organized into the following categories:\n\nCardiovascular health: Heart rate, heart rate variability, blood pressure, VO2 max\nVital signs: Body temperature, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate\nPhysical activity: Steps, distance, active energy burned, exercise duration, workouts\nBody metabolism: Basal metabolic rate, energy expenditure\nSleep & Mindfulness: Sleep duration, sleep stages, mindful minutes\nNutrition: Dietary intake, water consumption, macronutrients\nAnthropometrics: Weight, height, body mass index (BMI), body fat percentage\n\n\nData Processing Levels\nGoogle Fit: The data flow from Google Fit involves synchronization of wearable device data through the Google Fit platform, which stores the information in the cloud. Users grant permission for the HPP app to access this data, which is then processed and stored in the research database.\nApple Health: The data flow from Apple Health involves local storage on the user’s iOS device. The Health app aggregates data from Apple Watch and other connected devices. Users grant permission for the HPP app to access this data, which is then transmitted and stored in the research database.\nThe complete list of features and categories can be found in the 033_health_apps_dictionary data dictionary.",
