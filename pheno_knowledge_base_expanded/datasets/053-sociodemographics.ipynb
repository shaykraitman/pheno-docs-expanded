    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Sociodemographic data encompasses social, economic, and demographic characteristics of study participants that influence health outcomes and provide important context for interpreting health data. This includes information about ancestry and migration history, education, employment, household composition, living conditions, and socioeconomic status. These factors are essential for understanding health disparities, environmental exposures, and social determinants of health.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Human Phenotype Project conducts comprehensive data collection through online surveys, where participants voluntarily provide information on various aspects influencing their health. This includes sociodemographic data, captured through two lifestyle surveys (Inital UKBB and Follow-up UKBB survey) and the Initial Medical Survey.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Measurement protocol \n",
    "<!-- long measurment protocol for the data browser -->\n",
    "These lifestyle surveys are modeled after the UK Biobank's touch screen questionnaire. Participants receive the full version via email to complete on an online platform, either before or after their baseline visit. A shorter, follow-up version of the questionnaire is then filled out by participants during subsequent visits. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Data availability \n",
    "<!-- for the example notebooks -->\n",
    "The information is stored in 2 parquet files: `initial_medical.parquet`  and `ukbb.parquet` which contain the different data sources respectively the Initial Medical Survey and the  two lifestyle surveys (Inital UKBB and Follow-up UKBB survey).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of available data \n",
