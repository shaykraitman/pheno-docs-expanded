        "### Description\n",
        "The HPP Untargeted Metabolomics dataset contains high-throughput serum metabolomic profiles derived from HPP participants. The profiling utilizes liquid chromatography coupled with ion mobility–mass spectrometry (LC-IM-MS) to capture a broad spectrum of circulating small molecules, including diet-derived compounds, microbial metabolites, and host-related molecules.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Introduction\n",
        "As part of the HPP goal to deeply characterize the health-disease continuum, untargeted metabolomics provides a functional readout of the interplay between genetics, environment, and lifestyle. This dataset allows for the reconstruction of complex eating patterns and the identification of diet-disease mechanisms using objective molecular markers rather than self-reported data alone\n",

        "#### Sample preparation\n",
        "Serum samples were thawed on ice with a Tecan robotic platform and aliquoted into 96-well plates in batches of 320 (80 samples/rack, 4 racks/batch). These were then stored at –80 °C until analysis and were thawed on ice immediately prior to extraction. Protein precipitation was performed using an automated liquid handling system (epMotion 96xl, Eppendorf), by adding 400 µL of cold methanol to 100 µL of sample. Following mixing and centrifugation, 150 µL of the supernatant was collected and dried under vacuum. Dried serum extracts were reconstituted in 50 µL of methanol prior to UPLC–MS analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### UPLC Method\n",
        "Chromatographic separation was performed using an ACQUITY™ Premier UPLC™ system (Waters Corporation) equipped with an ACQUITY Premier BEH C18 column with VanGuard FIT guard (1.7 µm, 2.1 × 100 mm). Reverse-phase separation was carried out using mobile phase A: 0.025% (v/v) acetic acid in 95% water / 5% acetonitrile, and mobile phase B: 0.025% (v/v) acetic acid in 95% acetonitrile / 5% water. The flow rate was set to 0.35 mL/min, and the injection volume was 2 µL using partial-loop mode with needle overfill.\n",
        "\n",
        "The gradient elution program was as follows: 0 min, 100% A; linear decrease to 25% A at 4.0 min; to 0% A at 5.3 min; held at 0% A until 8.3 min; returned to 100% A at 8.5 min and held until 11.0 min for column re-equilibration.\n",
        "\n",
        "####  Ion Mobility–Mass Spectrometry (IM–MS) Analysis\n",
        "All analyses were performed using a Waters SELECT SERIES Cyclic IMS time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometer (Waters Corporation, Wilmslow, UK), equipped with an electrospray ionization (ESI) source and operated in negative ion mode. Data was acquired in high-definition MSE (HDMSE) mode over an m/z range of 50–1200, with a scan time of 0.1 s. Travelling wave ion mobility separation (TWIMS) was performed with a single pass of the cyclic device. Calibration of both the mass spectrometer and the ion mobility device was performed using the Major Mix IMS/TOF calibration solution prior to analysis. Data acquisition was conducted in V-mode using MassLynx software (Waters).\n",
        "\n",
        "Instrument parameters were optimized to enhance detection of small and labile compounds. Source conditions were set as follows: capillary voltage, 0.8 kV; cone voltage, 10 V; cone gas flow, 50 L/h; source offset voltage, 10 V; and desolvation temperature, 400°C. The body gradient, post-trap gradient, and transfer gradient voltages were maintained at 5 V, 3 V, and 4 V, respectively. A manual quadrupole (Quad) MS profile was used with set points of 60, 100 and 125 m/z, and dwell and ramp times all set to 25 %. StepWave RF voltage was set at 100 V; ion guide RF voltage, 150 V; and transfer RF voltage, 150 V. The cyclic and array traveling wave velocity was set at 375 m/s. Traveling wave ramp parameters included a start height of 10 V and an end height of 20 V, ramped at a rate of 0.5 V/ms. Inject and separate times were set at 2 and 4 ms, respectively, with TOF data collected at three pushes per bin.\n",

        "####  Processing and Annotation\n",
        "Raw data were processed using Progenesis QI software (version 3.0, Waters Corporation), including peak detection, alignment, and intra-batch normalization to adjust for technical variability within each analytical batch.\n",
        "\n",
        "Metabolites were putatively identified (MSI Level 2) using Progenesis QI. The integrated MetaScope search engine matched features against the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) using stringent criteria: a 5 ppm mass tolerance (with final annotations demonstrating <2 ppm mass accuracy), a 10 ppm product ion mass tolerance for MS/MS fragmentation, and a fragmentation score >60% (except for one Eicosapentaenoic acid metabolite). A minimum 90% isotopic pattern similarity was also mandated. For collision cross section (CCS) matching, all annotations exhibited a maximum 2.5% deviation from predicted HMDB values. Additionally, two metabolites were specifically identified with <2.5% deviation using the Metabolic Profiling CCS Library search plugin.\n",

        "Note: The dataset comprises approximately 2000 metabolite features, with roughly 10% chemically annotated at high confidence.\n"
