    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Lifestyle and environmental factors encompass a wide range of influences on an individual's health and well-being. These factors include behaviors such as physical activity patterns, sleep habits, smoking and alcohol consumption, dietary choices, sun exposure, and screen time, as well as environmental exposures like living conditions and commuting patterns. Together, they play a crucial role in determining overall health outcomes, impacting both the prevention and progression of diseases. Understanding these modifiable factors is essential for identifying opportunities for health interventions and for studying how daily behaviors and environmental contexts contribute to long-term health trajectories.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Human Phenotype Project conducts comprehensive data collection through online surveys, where participants voluntarily provide information on various aspects influencing their health. This includes lifestyle and enviroment data, captured through two lifestyle surveys.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Measurement protocol \n",
    "<!-- long measurment protocol for the data browser -->\n",
    "These lifestyle surveys are modeled after the UK Biobank's touch screen questionnaire. Participants receive the full version via email to complete on the Zoho platform, either before or after their baseline visit. A shorter, follow-up version of the questionnaire is then filled out by participants during subsequent visits. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Data availability \n",
    "<!-- for the example notebooks -->\n",
    "The information is stored in 1 parquet file: `lifestyle_and_environment.parquet`\n",
